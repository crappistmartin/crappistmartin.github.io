Berkeley Group's __'One Blackfriars'__ is a development of 274 luxury homes in a 50 storey glass tower with a total development value of £700m.

There will be no affordable housing on-site or off-site, instead the developer will pay £29m (4% of total value) in a series of staged payments to the council, towards its council house building programme. 

The [One Blackfriars planning application](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=12/AP/1784&system=DC) explains that the £29m in-lieu payment was lower than the £35.5m required by policy, on the grounds that the development will be providing a 'public viewing lounge', which is being provided at a cost of £5.5m to the developer.

The [officer's report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!N3XzHN1XX76Wjzxddhd13g%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the planning application says that (despite policy requirements for zero parking) the developer initially applied for 70% of the flats at One Blackfriars to have parking. This was negotiated down to 40% (110 parking spaces) but the developer argued that anything lower than this would affect the viability of the scheme and its ability to provide s106 contributions:

The development [came under fire](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/luxury-london-flat-advert-branded-the-creepiest-thing-you-will-ever-see-9966793.html) in January 2015, when its promoters produced a promotional film showing a couple arriving at the development in a private helicopter.
