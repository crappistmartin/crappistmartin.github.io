Bradman was originally selected as the council's development partner for the E&C regeneration back in April 2000, but his [masterplan](http://embed.verite.co/timeline/?source=0Aprl6XcACewydEhRaWFOLVBfUjBSVW1HUGVZNEhGeFE&font=Bevan-PotanoSans&maptype=toner&lang=en&hash_bookmark=true&start_zoom_adjust=2&height=650#6) came to an abrupt end when Southwark [terminated negotiations](http://embed.verite.co/timeline/?source=0Aprl6XcACewydEhRaWFOLVBfUjBSVW1HUGVZNEhGeFE&font=Bevan-PotanoSans&maptype=toner&lang=en&hash_bookmark=true&start_zoom_adjust=2&height=650#7) in April 2002.

The shopping centre was then [sold](http://www.standard.co.uk/business/markets/property-southwark-gets-a-new-lease-of-life-8841328.html) to a joint-venture between Kuwaiti real-estate group [__Salhia__](http://www.salhia.com) and West Midlands-based regeneration developer [__St Modwen__](http://stmodwen.co.uk) for £29m in 2004.

Having lost out to Lend Lease in its 2007 bid to be the council's regeneration partner for the Elephant including the Heygate, St Modwen put forward its proposals to the council for the redevelopment of the shopping centre. But it was knocked back due to the large number of residential units it wanted to build on the site; St Modwen [said](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5831) it needed to include 1000 residential units in the development to make it viable, but the council said it would [refuse](/images/Estates_Gazette_18March2014.pdf) to consider more than 500.
 
As a result of the stalemate, St Modwen [sold](/images/LRDeeds_ShoppingCentre.pdf) the shopping centre in 2014 for £80m to __Delancey DV4__, a developer funded by George Soros, managed by [Tory donor](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/party-funding-tory-coffers-benefit-from-fear-of-labour-mansion-tax-9716614.html) Jamie Ritblatt, registered in the British Virgin Islands and which has been [accussed](http://35percent.org/images/PrivateEyeNo1311.pdf) of _'aggressive tax avoidance'_.

Delancey was originally aiming to submit its planning applicaton by May 2015, but it seems this has now slipped. We can only assume that the stand off continues with the council over the number of residential and affordable housing units proposed.

Their message to the council is simple: _"agree to our proposals and make concessions on affordable housing provision, or we'll sit on the land and your regeneration won't happen any time soon."_

The question now is whether Southwark will roll over as easily as it did with Lend Lease. 

Another question is whether Southwark and Delancey will take into consideration the [campaign](http://coronettheatre.co.uk/home/save-the-coronet/) to save [The Coronet](http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/theatres/show/3344-coronet-london). The Coronet takes up a sizeable part of the shopping centre site. A music and event venue, it has also been a cinema and music hall [dating back to 1872](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7701) and is a popular local institution. Attempts are being made to try and have it listed on the basis of its Art Deco interior and exterior, which currently remains [hidden](http://35percent.org/images/SNcoronet.pdf) behind its blue corrugated facade.
