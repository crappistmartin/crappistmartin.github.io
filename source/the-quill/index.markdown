{% imgcap left /images/CapitalHouse.png 300 400 Capital House - KCL Guy's Campus %}On 8th Sep 2015, Southwark Council's planning committee granted planning permission for the demolition of __Capital House__ (a 10 storey building leased by KCL as part of its [Guy's campus](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/innovation/research/support/grants/contact/guys.aspx)) and its replacement by __'The Quill'__ - a 21 and 31 storey building connected via walkways and decorated with a quill-shaped spire, which the [architect](http://www.spparcstudio.com/Home.aspx) claims  [_"will draw on the literary connections of Southwark."_](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!lv%2bf4WD7hw9vUL41nLaBAA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) (para. 4.132)

The [planning application documents](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk:8190/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9558037) show that __The Quill__ will provide a total of 119 new homes. Southwark's 35% policy would normally require at least 41 of these to be provided as affordable housing units on-site, of which 13 would need to be shared ownership and 28 social rented. But the developer submitted a confidential viability assessment claiming that on-site provision of affordable housing would render the development financially unviable. Instead the developer has offered to provide 28% affordable housing off-site. It had originally offered to fund the construction of around 30 social rented homes on the Kipling estate, but this proposal was dropped following our [blog post](http://35percent.org/blog/2015/07/25/kipling-and-the-quill/) about it. 

Instead the developer has offered to make a payment to Housing Association __Family Mosaic__, to help it build 'affordable' homes at its [Amelia Street development](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=14/AP/2709&system=DC), a former Metropolitan Police depot off Walworth rd.

The [officer's report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!DNSoM%2fJqmT75pHW9KpHWsg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the Quill application doesn't say how much the in-lieu payment amounts to, only that _"The payment offered by the applicant has been identified as a reasonable sum that would assist Family Mosaic deliver an additional 8 rented and 8 intermediate homes on the site"_. The officer's report does not specify whether the 8 'rented' units will be social rented or affordable rented. The report also claims that a second in-lieu payment of £4.6m will be made if other sites cannot be found to provide the remaining balance of off-site units. 

Despite promises made by council leader Peter John earlier this year that viability assessments would be made public, the viability assessment for __The Quill__ has not been disclosed. Planning Committee councillor Adele Morris [claimed](https://twitter.com/AdeleCathedrals/status/641357961160323073) that whilst she hasn't seen the viability assessment itself, officers had confirmed that the Land Value assumed by the assessment was higher than than the £6m that [Land Registry documents](http://35percent.org/images/LR_Bilford.pdf) show was paid for the site by the developer.

Paragraph 105 of the [officer's report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!DNSoM%2fJqmT75pHW9KpHWsg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) confirms that the ground floor of the developement will not be used for active frontages like retail or bar/restaurant as policy requires, but argues that there will still be active frontage provided by the proposed use of the ground floor as a 'community centre' - albeit a private community centre for use only by Quill residents themselves.

In its recommendation for approval of the development, the officer's report argued that _"the scheme embraces and adapts to its context .. and presents an elegant and sculptural three-dimensional form that will compliment the local views"_ (para 108). 

[{% imgcap left http://35percent.org/images/carvil_bilford.png 300 500 Kim Humphries acting on behalf of Bilford %}](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!vH%2be%2bKK7uZu6GcJ8p3lqbQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)Representing and [advising](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/node/68) Quill developer __Bilford__ was former deputy council leader, turned development consultant Kim Humphries. Kim founded [__'Carvil Ventures'__](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/about-us) after losing his seat in 2010 and has been helping developers obtain planning permission ever since. Among his [clients](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/clients-partners) are __Delancey__, developers of the [Elephant & Castle shopping centre](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/elephant-castle-shopping-centre) and [185 Park Street](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/node/36); __Neobrand's__ [87 Newington Causeway development](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/node/69) and the massive [Canada Water](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/node/30) regeneration scheme.  

Kim also prepared Bilford's [Statement of Community Involvement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!pMcMh5jSJoLhoPr4hZ2nzw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) - a necessary planning document showing that the developer has consulted with the local community. Kim claims to have obtained __ _"extensive feedback"_ __ from his public consultation, in which he claims __ _"considerable support was expressed for Bilford's redevelopment plans with 60% supporting the proposals."_ __ However, page 15 of the [Statement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!pMcMh5jSJoLhoPr4hZ2nzw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d), shows that his claim of 60% support is based on a survey of just 15 people..
