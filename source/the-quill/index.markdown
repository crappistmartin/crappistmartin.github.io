{% imgcap left /images/CapitalHouse.png 300 400 Capital House - KCL Guy's Campus %}Developer [__'Investream'__](http://investream.com)- acting under the auspices of a shell company __'Bilford Ltd'__ ([registered](http://35percent.org/images/LR_Bilford.pdf) in Jersey) - has submitted a [planning application](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk:8190/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9558037) for the demolition of __Capital House__ (a 10 storey building leased by KCL as part of its [Guy's campus](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/innovation/research/support/grants/contact/guys.aspx)) and the construction of __'The Quill'__ - a 21 and 31 storey building connected via walkways and decorated with a quill-shaped spire, which the [architect](http://www.spparcstudio.com/Home.aspx) claims  [_"will draw on the literary connections of Southwark."_](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!lv%2bf4WD7hw9vUL41nLaBAA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) (para. 4.132)

__The Quill__ was orginally [granted](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7918) planning consent in 2011, but to provide student accommodation which was exempt from affordable housing requirements. This [new application](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk:8190/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9558037) seeks to convert the accommodation to private residential use, providing 119 new homes. Southwark's 35% policy would normally require at least 41 of these to be provided as affordable housing units on-site, of which 13 would need to be shared ownership and 28 social rented. Instead of meeting these on-site requirements, __Bilford__ has applied to fund the construction of around 30 social rented homes off-site on the Kipling estate.  

Bilford has submitted a detailed [Affordable Housing Statement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!a%2fXn%2fIRgCqJtDcLW0mQiuA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) with its application, along with a confidential viability assessment justifying why affordable housing provided on-site would render the development unviable.


[{% imgcap center http://35percent.org/images/quillahstatement.png Extract from The Quill planning application's affordable housing statement %}](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!a%2fXn%2fIRgCqJtDcLW0mQiuA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)

Technically __Bilford__ will be making the in-lieu payment to the council's S106 affordable housing fund, not directly to Leathermarket CBS and the council will in turn fund the Kipling estate project from its pooled S106 funds. This triangular accounting move provides a layer of separation, which enables Southwark to trumpet the Kipling project as part of its ambitious programme to build 11,000 new council homes.  

New social rented homes are good, but accepting them in-lieu of ones that should be provided on-site in new developments goes directly against the council's policy of creating mixed communities, which it used so vociferously in justifying the demoliton of its 'mono-tenure' Heygate & Aylesbury estates.

[{% imgcap left http://35percent.org/images/carvil_bilford.png 300 500 Kim Humphries acting on behalf of Bilford %}](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!vH%2be%2bKK7uZu6GcJ8p3lqbQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)Representing and [advising](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/node/68) __Bilford__ is former deputy council leader, turned development consultant Kim Humphries. Kim founded [__'Carvil Ventures'__](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/about-us) after losing his seat in 2010 and has been helping developers obtain planning permission ever since. Among his [clients](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/clients-partners) are __Delancey__, developers of the [Elephant & Castle shopping centre](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/elephant-castle-shopping-centre) and [185 Park Street](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/node/36); __Neobrand's__ [87 Newington Causeway development](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/node/69) and __British Land's__ [Canada Water](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/node/30) scheme.  

Kim also prepared Bilford's [Statement of Community Involvement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!pMcMh5jSJoLhoPr4hZ2nzw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) - a necessary planning document showing that the developer has consulted with the local community. Kim claims to have obtained __ _"extensive feedback"_ __ from his public consultation, in which he claims __ _"considerable support was expressed for Bilford's redevelopment plans with 60% supporting the proposals."_ __ But page 15 of the [Statement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!pMcMh5jSJoLhoPr4hZ2nzw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d), shows that his claim of 60% support is based on a survey of just 15 people..
