The Elephant & Castle is [officially](http://cycleinjury.co.uk/news/2012/03/08/top-20-londons-most-dangerous-cycling-junctions) the most dangerous traffic interchange in London for cyclists. In spite of this, the final masterplan application has dropped all plans to reduce traffic flows at the Elephant and actually proposes to expand the interchange to provide six lanes of traffic. The London Cycling Campaign has made a detailed critique of the plans on its website [here](http://lcc.org.uk/articles/we-urge-supporters-to-tell-transport-for-london-that-plans-for-elephant-and-castle-fail-to-provide-safe-passage-for-cycling).

The current proposals have departed significantly from the [original regeneration plans](http://www.scribd.com/doc/198503633/EandC-RegenMk1SLRplans), which proposed to _"give priority to pedestrians & cyclists"_ by removing the link road & creating a pedestrianised 'piazza' public square:

Furthermore, despite the fact that Elephant & Castle has the highest possible rating in terms of public transport accessibility, the Council's regeneration partner __Lend Lease__ is building over 700 parking spaces at the Elephant in what was intended to be an entirely car-free scheme<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>:  
__Heygate Outline Site:__ 616 parking spaces - see paragraph 15.1.2 of the [Transport Statement](http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/224093_1.pdf)
__Heygate Phase 1 Site:__ 47 parking spaces - see page 11 of the [Environmental Statement](https://www.iema.net/system/files/phase_one_nts_august_2012.pdf)</br>
__One the Elephant Site:__ 46 parking spaces - see paragraph 1.2 of the [Transport Statement](http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/238287_1.pdf)

According to planning officer [reports](http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/260032_1.pdf), Lend Lease has submitted viability assessments demonstrating that "_the proposed level of parking is justified on viability grounds"_.

The Proposed development is designed to support leisure cyclists rather than being used as a cycling commuter route through the development which may discourage less confident cyclists and conflict with pedestrian movement."_[(Transport Statement - paragraph 6.8.2)](http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/224093_1.pdf)
