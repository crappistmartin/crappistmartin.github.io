The Elephant & Castle regeneration has been hailed as a global example of sustainable growth. It was declared an 'Energy Action Area' by the GLA and in 2009 it was [announced](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8056859.stm) as one of 16 worldwide projects [signed up to the Clinton Climate Positive Development Program](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6032), which aims to create 'carbon zero' urban development.

{% img right /images/csh.png %}However, the [Energy Statement](http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/224079_1.pdf) in the planning application submitted by Heygate developer Lend Lease reveals that the 'zero carbon' target has fallen by the wayside. Lend Lease's application proposes to build the new homes just to CSH level 4 - the level 6 'zero carbon' target has been silently dropped.

Furthermore, the original regeneration agreement included plans to provide a [Multi-Utility Services Co.](https://www.buildingcentre.co.uk/downloads/underground_london.pdf) (MUSCo) renewable energy plant, which would provide _"centralised renewable energy generation, where possible using locally derived sources of renewable fuel"_ for all new developments at the Elephant. It was also [going to supply](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=16241) the new Aylesbury estate development and the existing Salisbury and Newington housing estates, making it the [largest biomass-fuelled district heating network](/images/muscoarea.png) in London. However, the MUSCo plans were eventually dropped from the Lend Lease Regeneration Agreement because the estimated costs were too high. The scheme had become a _'fairy tale fantasy'_ [according]((http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5052) to the Council's own cabinet member for regeneration.

__The 'Boiler House' Solution__  
{% img right /images/heygateboilerhouse.JPG %}Instead of the MUSCo, Lend Lease is building an _'Energy Centre'_ on the Heygate site, which is essentially a gas-fired boiler supplying just the homes on the Heygate site. This will replace the previous gas-fired boiler on the Heygate, which supplied heat and hot water through a district heating network (DHN) [to over 2,000 homes](/images/HeygateDHN.png) on both the Heygate and the neighbouring Salisbury estate. The new district heating network will be smaller and not extend beyond the Heygate footprint - it will not supply the Salisbury estate, and will not be supplying telecoms, potable water, non-potable water, drainage, gas, fibre-optics and vacuum waste as the original MUSCo had planned to. Proposals to supply other estates and developments have been dropped, and all methods of supplying heat and water that rely on renewable sources of energy have been rejected on grounds of their [cost impact on viability](/blog/2012/07/03/its-all-about-financial-viability/). 


The implications for the 'zero carbon' objectives are clearly far reaching, but beyond this there is one further complication: Southwark Council has set a planning policy requirement that all new major developments [_"must achieve a reduction in CO2 of 20% from using on-site or local low and zero carbon sources of energy."_](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/5823/adopted_core_strategy) 
 
The originally planned biomass CHP boiler would have met this on-site reneweables requirement several times over. However, Lend Lease's planning application states quite clearly that the _'impact on commercial viability'_ i.e. the high capital cost of a biomass boiler is the reason that it has been rejected.

Lend Lease acknowledges in its Energy Statement that its application does not currently fulfill this 20% on-site requirement. It attempts to mitigate this by providing a few symbolic solar panels and claiming that it will seek to source some of its gas from renewable gas sources. It states that one possible future source of renewable gas may be procured from [biomethane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogas) plants located off site, which would work in the same way as green electricity currently does. However, the problem is that there is currently only [one operational biomethane injection plant](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11433162) in the UK and this has no spare capacity. 

We do not believe that the proposed development will contribute towards achieving the sustainability objectives set out in the local planning policy and the original regeneration plans. We are also concerned that there is a fundamental flaw in the carbon accounting methods used by Lend Lease: the calculations currently used do not include embodied carbon, which would take into account the carbon cost of both demolition of the existing - structurally sound - buildings and construction of the new development. It also fails to include the carbon sequestration value of the 406 mature trees on the site and the carbon cost associated with their removal.
