{% img right http://dailybail.com/storage/bill-clinton-404_683090c.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1285011722646 300 200 %}Last week, Elephant & Castle developer Lend Lease was [awarded participant status](http://www.standard.co.uk/business/markets/property-southwark-gets-a-new-lease-of-life-8841328.html) in Bill Clinton's Global Climate Initiative. According to [C40 Cities Group](http://www.c40cities.org/c40blog/leading-the-way-forward-progress-in-australia) - a group of cities world-wide combating the effects of climate change - __ _‘Climate Positive Development Partners have made a commitment to achieve net-negative, on-site, operational greenhouse gas emissions’_ __.

The Elephant’s regeneration [first attracted](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8056859.stm) the Clinton foundation’s attention while it still included plans for having a Multi Utilities Services Company (MUSCo) as part of the Heygate and shopping centre redevelopment. This would have produced 100% renewable energy on-site, with zero carbon emissions, and possibly more than was needed, making it ‘carbon positive’.

<h4> MUSCo vs Emission Reductions</h4>
{% img left http://www.bdunlop.com/images/Elephant-and-Castle/energy_envrnmtl-services_lge.gif 300 200 %}The Global Climate Initiative participant status has been awarded to Lend Lease for reducing operational emissions, in other words reducing day-to-day C02 emissions from homes and businesses. The MUSCo would have done more than this: it would have provided its own renewable energy making the entire development self-sufficient. The [MUSCo was dropped](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5052) from the Regeneration Agreement Southwark signed with Lend Lease in 2010. 
Instead of producing renewable energy on-site through the MUSCo Lend Lease are planning to buy in biomethane gas from off-site producers, rather like using a green electricity tariff. 
A close reading of this [Energy Strategy](http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&RIPNAME=Root.PgeResultDetail&TheSystemkey=9550213) tells us that while it might have won an award from Bill Clinton, it does not conform to Southwark Council’s planning policy requirements:

Lend Lease assert that notwithstanding this failure, energy emissions will be over 50% less than they would have been without the its strategy of ‘energy hierarchy principles and…energy commitment’. It also lives in hope that Southwark will have a change of heart;

In short, Lend Lease’s energy strategy is simply to buy in biomethane gas and hope that Southwark brings its planning policy into line with its proposals.

Biomethane can be a good source of renewable energy but it does need plant to produce it, which is why Southwark's policy requires it to be on-site. The policy needs improving too: the renewables requirement currently stands at 20%, the MUSCo would have provided 100% - which is what is needed if we want truly sustainable cities.
