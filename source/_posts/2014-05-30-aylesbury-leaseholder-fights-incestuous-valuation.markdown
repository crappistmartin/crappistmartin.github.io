In buying back homes on the estate the Council has consistently maintained that all leaseholders are given 'market value' in compensation for the loss of their homes. Last week [we learned](/blog/2014/05/16/southwark-gives-green-light-to-slum-landlords/) how it arrives at its market value calculation by using illegaly-converted flats as comparable market evidence. This week we learned more about its valuation procedures. 

The claimant was a Mrs Olubunmi John, formerly of 28 Wolverton on the Aylesbury estate and now living in the Kent borders. She was represented by [Avery Associates](http://www.averyassociatessurveyors.com/) chartered surveyors and a barrister from [Tanfield Chambers](http://www.tanfieldchambers.co.uk/Barristers/Stan_Gallagher). Mrs John's surveyor had originally carried out a survey and valued her 3-storey, 4-bed maisonette at £288,750. In adjusting for market conditions he increased this to £297,500 on the date she and her family had to leave. The council's valuation of Mrs John's home on the day it took possession was just £165,000.

The hearing began with Mrs John's representatives producing a council-commissioned report confirming that the buildings were structurally sound. This quickly defeated earlier unevidenced intimations by the council that the Aylesbury estate's buildings had structural issues. 

The barrister then questioned the impartiality of the Southwark council officer who decided on the compensation offer. He pointed out that other boroughs use an independent valuer - somebody from outside the council to decide how much the property is worth. The compensation is then based upon this objective valuation. Southwark Council keep it all 'in house': they decide their own valuation and then offer that amount as compensation. Most other London Boroughs - [Sutton](http://sutton.moderngov.co.uk/Data/Strategy%20Committee/20040608/Agenda/$Item%2016.doc.pdf),  [Kensington & Chelsea](http://bit.ly/1pqMVho), [Newham](http://www.newham.gov.uk/Documents/Environment%20and%20planning/Carpenters%20Estate%20Residents%20Charter.pdf),
[Hackney](http://debeauvoircouncillors.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/colville-estate-regeneration-what-is.html) and Lewisham to name just a few - all rely on valuations from independent external valuers as the basis for their negotiations.

He referred to Greenwich Council doing just this on the [Ferrier estate](http://halag.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/ferrier.pdf) regeneration in Kidbrooke. The Tribunal there rejected the practice as 'incestuous' when it heard an appeal from a Ferrier leaseholder in 2007 and ordered the use of properties off the estate to be used as comparables when calculating compensation.


The barrister went on to claim that the Council was undervaluing properties on the Aylesbury and that this was demonstrated by the high returns that buy-to-let investors were making on the estate. He showed evidence that the properties were averaging a 13% yield - more than double the current average return on investment for properties in London which stands at around 6%. Using the London average figure and average rents on the Aylesbury to calculate the market value of Mrs John's home gives a figure of around £300,000 - nearly double the council's offer. But even this amount is unlikely to buy her a new home in the swanky new [Harvard Gardens](http://www.albany-place.co.uk) - the development replacing her Aylesbury home. 

The Lands Tribunal should be there to protect people like Mrs John and her neighbours, including the 130 or so [elderly leaseholders](http://heygate.github.io/img/SNWolverton.pdf) left on the estate, but the risk of taking on Southwark Council and losing is too high and Southwark Council is taking full of advantage of the fact. One of the first things the new labour administration must do is start offering the estate's leaseholders decent and fair compensation for the loss of their homes.  


<h2>Meet the 'pop-up' neighbours</h2>

The event was marketed on the ['Shoreditch Hype'](http://shoreditch.hypeapp.co/shared-events/14034/) website inviting _'designer-maker'_ or creative businesses to _'head south for Pop-ups'_ bringing the East London vibe to the Elephant. Prospective tenants were [invited](https://www.facebook.com/events/824753570885436/) to come and _'meet the neighbours'_ at the nearly completed container boxpark located the former Elephant Park - formerly designated public open space until its [controversial enclosure](http://www.35percent.org/blog/2012/07/04/londons-largest-new-private-park-in-70-years) in 2012.

In conjunction with the Latin American Women’s Rights Service, local artists Rebecca Davies and Eva Sajovic will be opening __the People's Bureau__ for a few days on Friday 30th May, Saturday 31st May and Monday 2nd June.

The People's Bureau is a space and a network to exchange skills and needs. The pilot will run for three days from 11:00 - 17:00 at Unit 306 in the Elephant and Castle Shopping Centre.

The aim of the People's Bureau is to create a pool of collective local knowledge through exchange, a supporting network of different skills and to draw attention to the diversity and existence of different economies in the Elephant and Castle.
