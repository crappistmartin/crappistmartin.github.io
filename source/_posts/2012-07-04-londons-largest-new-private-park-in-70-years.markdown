{% img right /images/elephantpark.JPG %}The Heygate estate used to have a sizeable public park ([Elephant Park](https://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/elephant-rd.jpg)). The park had long been designated public open space in the council's planning policy[^1]. In 2006 the council described the site as _"being poor in terms of security and a problem site requiring action"_ It was removed from open space designation on the basis that _"The space principally addresses the needs of Heygate residents and following the demolition of the estate there will no longer be a need for this type of estate-based facility"_[^2]. The park was finally closed in 2011 despite [fierce opposition](http://elephantamenity.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/no-more-football-on-the-elephant-park/) from local residents and subsequently leased to the neighbouring [Delancey development](http://35percent.org/tribeca-square) to be used as a 'market square'.  

According to [this 2002 audit by planning consultant Michael Parkes,](/images/HeygateCommunityAssetAudit.pdf) the Heygate estate used to comprise a total 24,195 square metres of public amenity open space.

{% img left /images/parkdimensions.png 300 200 %}Much fanfare has been made of Lend Lease's plan to create [central London's largest park in more than 70 years'](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/672/final_masterplan_for_heygate_estate_revamp_revealed). However, according to Lend Lease's [planning application](http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&RIPNAME=Root.PgeResultDetail&TheSystemkey=9544643), the new park will be just 8,220 square metres in size - representing a net loss of more than two thirds of the site's open amenity space. When probed during the Feb 2013 CPO public inquiry into the scheme, architect [Ken Shuttleworth said](/images/KenShuttleworthCPOevidenceFeb2013.pdf) the 70 years reference related to the nearby Geraldine Harmsworth Park (Imperial War Museum) as being the larger park opened in 1934. We did a little research and found that the claim to being central London's largest new park in 70 years is pure fiction and plainly ridiculous. Infact, it's not even the largest new park in Southwark in 70 years - let alone central London: the following [Southwark parks](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!3CFumZzyYn8kb1LBVrWDlg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) are all larger than the one proposed by Lend Lease (0.82H) and have all received open space designation since the Geraldine Harmsworth park was opened in 1934:

    *Potter's Field  1.35H
    *Mint Street Park  .92H
    *Leathermarket Gardens 1.15H 
    *Tabard Gardens  1.75H
    *Dickens Fields  1.20H  



[{% img right /images/parkcrosssection.png 400 300 %}](http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/224246_1.pdf)The [planning application](http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/254738_1.pdf) also shows that the Heygate development's new park will be just 42m wide (around the same width as New Kent rd), overshadowed by 12-30 storey buildings and hemmed in by a new road servicing the development's [616 new car-parking spaces](/transport-hub):

This is a real kick in the teeth for local residents who can remember the promises of the original regeneration plans. These proposed a sizeable public park and public open space on the site of the Heygate as can be seen from the [original masterplan](http://www.scribd.com/doc/198503633/EandC-RegenMk1SLRplans) illustrations:

Furthermore, the remaining green spaces on the development will consist of 'raised courtyards' enclosed between clusters of blocks, which will have zero public access:
  
[{% img http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/heygate_raised_courtyards2.png %}](http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/267119_1.pdf)

But what is even more disconcerting is that the planning application's ['Estate Management Strategy' statement](http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/224077_1.pdf) states that the new park - and indeed the entire footprint of the development - is going to be privately owned and privately managed:

_"The long term regeneration vision is founded on the core principles of place making and central to this is the effective management of the spaces around Plots in addition to effective Plot and building management."_

_"It is likely that an umbrella Estate Management Company (EMC) will be created, with separate Plot Management Companies responsible for managing each Plot sitting under it. Each Plot will have its own Plot Management Company (PMC). Each PMC will be controlled by the leasehold owners of the new homes, the Registered Provider and the leasehold owners of the retail spaces within the Plot."_

_"The Estate Management Company (EMC) will hold the land on a long leasehold basis from Lend Lease. The Estate Management Company shall be controlled by a main board of directors responsible for managing the company."_  
{% img /images/emc.png %}  


The Estate Management Strategy appears to have quite clear ideas of how the behaviour of its residents will be monitored and controlled:

_"__7.5 Anti‐Social Behaviour Policy__ - The principles set out in the Anti‐Social Behaviour Policy will lay out common standards for the delivery of effective anti‐social behaviour services across the Estate, the Plots and as part of tenancy and leasehold management."_ </br> 

The behaviour of non-residents will be monitored by a 'Town Centre Security Team' and as the private owner of the land it will be legally entitled to expel any members of the public indulging in subversive activities like photography or picnicing:

_"__8.2 Security__ - The EMC and PMCs will have a key role in linking with local agencies, in particular the police, Southwark’s Anti‐Social Behaviour (ASB) services and the town centre security team and the local Community Safety teams."_  


Further reference to the planned privatisation of the space can be found in the [draft illustrative masterplan](http://southwark.gov.uk/download/elephant_and_castle_regeneration_agreement_appendix6.pdf): _"To ensure that the high quality external environment is maintained the completed RA site will be managed by its own security, maintanence and cleaning service."_

Furthermore, the 'Play Strategy' [(in the Landscape Strategy, pg 93)](http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/224082_1.pdf) proposes off-site provision of recreational space for older children (i.e over 12) on the basis that on site provision _"is not considered practical or desirable, in respect to the intended character, use or scale of the space"_. The picture that emerges is one of a tightly controled privatised space, from which local young people will be actively excluded. This is a contravention of the Equalities Act 2010, which bans discrimination on the basis of age.

{% img right http://betterelephant.org/images/gatedcommunity.png 350 493 %}We have been campaigning to have arrangements here formalised by the Council, in order to avoid the [‘privatised public space’ model](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/11/public-spaces-undemocratic-land-ownership) – places like More London or New Street Square. 

Lend Lease owns the Bluewater retail and leisure centre in Kent, where it has banned shoppers who swear or wear hooded tops or baseball caps. It has also outlawed smoking, leafleting and canvassing on the 240-acre Bluewater site. We don't want Lend Lease to use Bluewater as a blueprint for its Heygate redevelopment. The Mayor of London's 2009 Manifesto for Public Space expresses concern at the _"growing trend towards the private management of publicly accessible space, where this type of ‘corporatisation occurs, especially in the larger commercial developments, Londoners can feel themselves excluded from parts of their own city."_ This need not be the case: at the Kings Cross redevelopment it was agreed that the London Borough of Camden will adopt the streets and public areas; unfortunately Southwark has rejected all calls for it to do the same.
