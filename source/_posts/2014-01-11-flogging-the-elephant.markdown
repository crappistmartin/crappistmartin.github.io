The site will now be home to ['One the Elephant'](http://www.onetheelephant.com) - a 37 storey tower with 4 storey pavillion. _Lend Lease_ also recently acquired the 23-acre Heygate estate site for a [generous £50m](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/elephant-and-castle-estate-revamp-ripped-off-taxpayers-8482794.html).  </br></br>

{% img right http://affordable.heroku.com/images/onetheelephant.jpg 400 400 %}By way of comparison, the neighbouring and smaller site (1.2acres) of the former London Park Hotel was bought by a government agency [for £17.7m in 2004](http://affordable.heroku.com/images/360TowerLandRegistry.pdf). New shopping centre owners _Delancey_ [had to pay £40m](http://betterelephant.org/images/OakmayneLandRegistry.pdf) for another neighbouring site (Tribeca Square - 1.5 acres) to property developer _Eadon Ltd_, who thereby made a handsome profit having [bought the land for just £18m](http://affordable.heroku.com/images/TribecaLR.pdf) from the council in March 2007.

Instead Lend Lease proposed a payment of £3.5m towards the £25m cost of the new (pint-size) leisure centre. This payment is a fraction of Southwark's [affordable housing policy tariff](http://affordable.heroku.com/images/affordablehousingspg.pdf), which should have netted it £33.2m. On the other hand [61% of Lend Lease's new homes at the Elephant have been pre-sold off plan](http://lendlease2013.reportonline.com.au/annual-report/europe) to overseas buyers. [The Land Registry documents](http://affordable.heroku.com/images/OneTheElephantRegisterTGL381808.pdf) also reveal that 10 of the new flats at 'One the Elephant' had even been sold before the land sale had even been processed. Of the 10 new owners registered 6 come from overseas: - 4 from Singapore; 1 from British Virgin Islands; 1 from Hong Kong; and the remaining 4 were snapped up by UK-based property investment companies.

The buoyant sales are undoubtedly due in part to [Lend Lease's sales pitch](http://www.onetheelephant.com/facilities/leisure-centre) that new homes would have a brand new leisure centre on their doorstep.

Once completed, Lend Lease's 'One the Elephant' development is expected to be worth around £200m<a href="#footnote-1">[1].

The revelation comes [amidst separate news](http://affordable.heroku.com/images/SNleisurecentre.pdf) that council chiefs had ignored the results of a public poll created in order to name the new leisure centre, in favour of a suggestion put forward by Lend Lease.  

In October 2012, government body _Sport for England_ [criticised the council's plans](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6367) to reduce the size of sports facilities at the leisure centre site.

<h4>Pleading Poverty - Viability Assessments</h4>
The deal that allows Lend Lease to maximise its profits by selling abroad and minimise its costs by cutting affordable housing, is justified by a [notorious viability assessment](http://www.35percent.org/blog/2013/07/30/how-to-avoid-providing-affordable-housing-a-guide-for-developers). A similar assessment was [used for the Heygate](http://www.35percent.org/blog/2012/07/03/its-all-about-financial-viability) planning application, and in July 2013 the [Information Commissioner ruled](http://www.35percent.org/blog/2013/07/24/heygate-figures-must-b-be-revealed-information-commissioner) that it is heavily in the public interest that the public should get the chance to see the facts and figures behind Lend Lease's claim that they could not afford all the Heygate's affordable housing. The Tribunal hearing is due to take place on 3rd to 7th February.

Joining _Lend Lease_ and Southwark in the noble cause of defending the developer's rights to know everything and tell the public next to nothing, are Boris Johnson's Greater London Authority and one of the world's largest real estate firms _Savills_. Amongst the [arguments being put forward](http://betterelephant.org/blog/2013/09/25/lend-lease-is-not-human/) by Lend Lease is that disclosure would be a breach of its human rights under article 1 of the Human Rights Act. 




Council leader Peter John gave his reasons for resisting the Information Commissioner's decision in a [statement](http://affordable.heroku.com/images/TranscriptOverviewScrutiny.pdf) during a recent council meeting. He conceded that revealing the figures might not have any adverse impact on Southwark housing developments at all, but he is worried about the impact it could have on property developers elsewhere in the country, who may decide that it is better not to build unless they can keep their finances secret. 

We don't think that Cllr John should worry too much about property developers - they are well able to look after themselves and when it suits them they are also happy enough to reveal viability assessments. The assessments for all of the following developments were revealed at planning appeal stage and nonetheless proceeded merrily:

    *Albert Embankment Development
    *Doon Street Development
    *Bondway and the Vauxhall Island Development
    *Poplar Business Park Development
    *King's Cross Regeneration Development
    *Walthamstow Stadium Development 

It should be noted that most of these developments didn't entail the huge transfer of public land that the Heygate development requires. So the case for revealing the facts and the figures that allowed this to happen - without getting the affordable housing in return - is that much stronger, and as the Information Commissioner said in his report: disclosure is __ _"heavily in the public interest"_ __.
