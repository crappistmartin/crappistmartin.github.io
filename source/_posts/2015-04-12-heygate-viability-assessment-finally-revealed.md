After three years of appeals by Southwark Council & development partner Lend Lease, Adrian Glasspool has finally received the Heygate viability assessment in response to his [May 2012 FOI/EIR request](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/viability_assessment_for_plannin?unfold=1). Southwark had initially rejected his request and appealed after his subsequent complaint to the Information Commissioner had been [upheld](http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2013/fer_0461281.ashx). A long battle through the Tribunal system then culminated in a 6 day [hearing](http://35percent.org/blog/2014/02/11/heygate-tribunal-hearing-extended/) in February last year, followed by a [decision notice](http://heygate.github.io/img/FirstTierDecisionHeygate.pdf) directing Southwark to release the assessment minus some of its financial modelling figures[^1]. Following a further dispute about which figures were allowed to be withheld, the Tribunal reconvened and issued a [final decision](http://www.informationtribunal.gov.uk/DBFiles/Decision/i1505/London%20Borough%20of%20Southwark%20EA.2013.0162%20%2810.3.15%29%202nd%20Decision.pdf) in March this year. The Heygate case has since triggered decisions to disclose viability information for other large regeneration schemes including [Earls Court regeneration](http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2013/fer_0491596.ashx) and [Greenwich Peninsula](http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2014/fer_0524770.pdf). 

As well as the viability assessment, the 35% campaign has also received a heavily redacted copy of the District Valuer Service appraisal of the viability assessment, commissioned by Southwark council.  

## First impressions
1. Profitability assessment- not viability assessment
Lend Lease commissioned Savills to produce the viability assessment and it is clear from the disclosed information that __unviable doesn't mean unprofitable.__ Savills tested to see how the development could provide an 'acceptable' level of return (i.e. profit margin) - and sets the level of affordable housing accordingly.
 
2. 25% is the acceptable level of profit
Savills settled on 25% as an acceptable level of profit and the minimum needed to test the viability of the scheme - 'the viability benchmark'.

No explanation is given as to why 25% profit was used as the benchmark, rather than the 20% profit on cost Lend Lease and Southwark had negotiated in the Regeneration Partnership Agreement[^2], but Savills does say this:

![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/savillsdr.png)

The DVS was not impressed with this explanation. __ _"I do not adopt the profit benchmark that Savills have adopted.."_ __

He goes on:

![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/DVSacceptablereturn.png)

Nonetheless, the 25% figure (equivalent to approx £300m[^4]) was used as the benchmark.

This does not mean that Lend Lease will make any more profit than the 20% agreed in the Regeneration Agreement (in cash terms ca. £250m)[^4], but it does inflate the projected development costs and allow the consequent reduction of affordable housing, to meet the higher benchmark figure and in the event the number of social rented units was reduced from the 432[^3] required by policy [to just 74](/affordable-housing) and the total number of 'affordable' homes to 603 units. 

At the Tribunal hearing council officers acknowledged that they did not actually see the assessment themselves, but depended entirely upon the DVS. He said that 25% profit was too high and the Regeneration Agreement has 20% so why did Southwark allow 25% to be used?



3. Residential sales prices were underestimated

An important part of the viability assessment is the anticipated sales prices of the new homes. If this is underestimated it reduces the amount of money that could be used for affordable housing. Savills estimated to sell at an average of £600 per sqft. 

At the Tribunal hearing, Southwark council officials confirmed that the __ _"DVS considered that a number of the projections in the viability assessment were too conservative. For example, the projected values of the units in the high-rise blocks were too low"_ __. The DVS report had specifically flagged up Lend Lease's sales projection in the viability assessment as problematic, mainly due to the lack of comparable developments at the Elephant: 

![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/DVSreport_extract.png)

As a result of these concerns and, as confirmed in the Director of Planning's evidence __ _"the DVS suggested that there should be some level of safeguarding by way of a review mechanism linked with delivery."_ __(para 92).

But Southwark ultimately failed to implement this crucial DVS recommendation. Its justification for not doing so is found in the [planning case officer's report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!hgyBVuEH%2b8BxXry2bGRAtA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d). In paragraph 150, it claims that the DVS says 9.4% is viable level and gap is so large that it's not worth including a review mechanism". 

But then we found out that 9.4% was just one of 28 scenarios:

![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/DVS28scenarios.png)

As a result flats that were predicted to sell for £600 per sqft are now selling for an average of £900 per sqft.

{ imgfromappendix12conclusion private values on the site should be 600 - 700 per square foot }

In fact, Lend Lease's viability assessment estimated that its private flats in both high and low-rise blocks would sell for an overall average of £598 per sqft:

{ imgof main report cutout }




Strata achieved £829 per square foot (http://www.colliers.com/~/media/Files/EMEA/UK/research/residential/201202-central-london-residential-market.pdf)

With Lend Lease having sold just 20% of its units so far, it has xxx new homes coming forward over the next 10 years before the Heygate development is due to complete in 2025. Any further increase in sales values will be converted directly into Lend Lease profit. Despite recommendations from the DVS, there is no effective review mechanism in the planning permission that will allow the affordable housing contribution to benefit from any improved viability of the scheme.   




<h2>Balance Sheet</h2>
It also has to be borne in mind that it has lost 1,000 council houses and has displaced 179 leaseholders. Most of the affordable housing it is getting in return is not affordable and is getting just 74 social rented units. 

The viability assessment is a long and complicated document and they said we were too dum to understand it, but we have many sympathetic friends with the knowledge to understand it and we will be reporting on their views. 

Watch this space!

In the meantime here is a short summary of some of the other things we found out from the viability assessment and Tribunal evidence accompanied by a chronology of proceedings.[link to pdf of factsheet]() (add paragraph on 'data room' suggestion)
