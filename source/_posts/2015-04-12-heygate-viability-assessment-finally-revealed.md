<img src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/ViabilityAssessment.png" width="250" align="right">After three years of appeals by Southwark Council & development partner Lend Lease, Adrian Glasspool finally received the Heygate viability assessment in response to his May 2012 [FOI/EIR request](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/viability_assessment_for_plannin?unfold=1). Southwark had initially rejected his request and appealed after his subsequent complaint to the Information Commissioner had been [upheld](http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2013/fer_0461281.ashx). A long battle through the Tribunal system then culminated in a 6 day [hearing](http://35percent.org/blog/2014/02/11/heygate-tribunal-hearing-extended/) in February last year, which was followed by a [decision notice](http://35percent.org/blog/2014/05/10/foi-appeal-decision/) issued by the Information Tribunal in May last year [directing](http://heygate.github.io/img/FirstTierDecisionHeygate.pdf) Southwark to release the assessment minus some of its financial modelling figures[^1]. Following a further dispute about which figures were allowed to be withheld, the Tribunal reconvened and issued a [final decision](http://www.informationtribunal.gov.uk/DBFiles/Decision/i1505/London%20Borough%20of%20Southwark%20EA.2013.0162%20%2810.3.15%29%202nd%20Decision.pdf) in March this year. The Heygate case has since triggered decisions to disclose viability information for other large regeneration schemes including [Earls Court regeneration](http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2013/fer_0491596.ashx) and [Greenwich Peninsula](http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2014/fer_0524770.pdf). 


# Our first impressions
## Viability (or profitability) benchmark
The first thing that struck us from the disclosed information is that __unviable doesn't mean unprofitable.__ A viability assessment tests to see if a development provides an 'acceptable' level of developer's return (i.e. profit) - not whether it breaks even.
 
This minimum profit requirement provides the 'viability benchmark' against which the projected profit is compared to see if the development is viable. If the viability assessment shows an estimated profit below the 'viablity benchmark' then affordable housing is reduced until profit increases to the benchmark level. In this case Lend Lease claimed it required 24% profit as its viability benchmark and the number of social rented units were consequently [reduced to 74](/affordable-housing) in order for it to achieve this. 
 
In justifying its high profit requirement, Lend Lease's Development Director explained in his [Tribunal evidence](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ljlg8vgt2zywied/RobHeasmanLegallyPrivileged%26Confidential.pdf) that _"Lend Lease is, of course, a profit-making company and, as a listed company, is responsible to its shareholders"_(para 57); and that _"if investors do not have confidence that they will earn an adequate rate of return on their investment, the project will not be fundable."_(para 58)

The second thing to strike us came when we realised that not only was Lend Lease requiring a high profit margin, but its 24% requirement in the viability assessment was higher than the 20% it had agreed contractually in its partnership agreement with the council. 

We know this because it's stated in the Regeneration Agreement between Southwark and Lend Lease, which was accidentally leaked in 2013:


![](image of regen agrement cutout 20%)

But why didn't the council's planning officers pick up on this and flag it up when the viability assessment was submitted?





During the 2 year Tribunal battle, Lend Lease had offered various compromises offering to disclose various figures. The viability benchmark was one of the last key figures we were perplexed as to why this key figure was one which Southwark & Lend Lease fought so bitterly to withhold We know from the leaked Heygate Regeneration Agreement that Southwark had agreed a 20% developer's return for Lend Lease. But now we know why: the viability assessment used a higher level of developer's return than the 20% that had been agreed with Southwark. [img pg. 28]


In summary: the viability assessment required a higher developer's profit than the 20% agreed contractually. As explained by Given the 
Comment from Bob/Pat "astonished that the local authority would accept "
Southwark didn't open viability assessment - it sent it straight to DVS. DVS didn't know that 20% profit had been agreed

Cost of the social rented units -> how much to build?
How many social rented units could one have built with the gap?

Neo Bankside devlopers content with 13% profit and Tribeca square with 12%. Why Lend Lease requires 20% and how did it get away with putting in a higher figure for the purposes of the viability assessment?




[img insert cut-out of para 10.1. ]
Savills (who conducted the viability assessment) claimed that xx% _"does not meet or exceed an acceptable risk-adjusted market return and is therefore unviable"_.



Lend Lease [reported](http://www.smh.com.au/business/property/bluewater-sale-inflates-lend-lease-profit-20140827-108w3h.html) net profits (after tax) this year of £450m (AUD $822m). 






It claimed that Lend Lease should be entitled to at least 20% profit, because this is the minimum profit required _"in order to secure development funding"_ (para 7.6). But we found in its annual report that Lend Lease will be funding the scheme itself via its 'Integrated Property Model'[^3]. This also means that its construction subsidiary will be creaming off profits from the development accounting in addition to the 20% developer's priority return. 

Developers of the Neo Bankside development were happy with a 13% profit margin in their [viability assessment](http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/6014_1.pdf) and this was a development on private land with no council involvement. We don't understand why Lend Lease is requiring 20% when the lions share of the risk is borne clearly by the council: The council is the landowner, development partner and planning authority; it has so far spent £65m emptying[^4] & £20m demolishing[^5] the estate where Lend Lease has spent just £14m[^6]; Paragraph 75 of the [Project Director's evidence](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o5cnv7qtjcvdnpf/Southwark-Jon%20Abbott.pdf) says that _"Lend Lease is entitled under the Regeneration Agreement to pull out of the project"_ and the following paragraph says that the council would be required to reimburse Lend Lease _"the sum of around £10m"_ if it did so; the council has so far received £15m in phased land payments which will eventually total £50m[^7] equalling less than its total expenditure on the scheme. 

There will also be extra profit - known as overage or 'super-profit' - which is any surplus profit left over and cannot be quantified until the development is complete. Furthermore, because Lend Lease maintains full control of the business model, any overage is calculated by Lend Lease on a good faith basis. Needless to say, Lend Lease's [track record](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/nyregion/lend-lease-expected-to-admit-to-fraud-scheme.html?) in [large scale PFI](http://www.thelondonmagazine.co.uk/property-experts/expert-opinions/the-olympic-village.html)s is hardly exemplary and if its [Sydney harbour development](http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/valuation-dispute-poses-threat-to-1b-return-from-barangaroo-20121206-2ay9e.html) is anything to go by Southwark will have to resort to litigation if it wants to recoup any overage. 


## Underestimations
We reported in a previous blog that developers of the Neo Bankside development had undervalued their development by £143m in order to avoid providing any on-site affordable housing. Only a relatively small proportion of the Heygate new-build flats have been sold to date so we don't know yet how much it has been undervalued by, but we do know that the flats are currently on sale for significantly more than the viability assessment estimate of £xxx/sqft. We found a total of [34 properties](http://github.io/heygate-new-build-sales/) on Zoopla advertising new-builds for sale on the Heygate masterplan site, the average £/sqft sale price of these was £792/sqft.   

Here's link to West Grove Price list: http://heygatewashome.org/img/WestGrove_EP.pdf

Evening Standard estimates between £800 and £1,000 per square foot (http://www.homesandproperty.co.uk/property-news/new-homes/live-alongside-londons-new-cycle-superhighway-quickest-commutes)  

Strata achieved £829 per square foot (http://www.colliers.com/~/media/Files/EMEA/UK/research/residential/201202-central-london-residential-market.pdf)

With Lend Lease having sold just 20% of its units so far, it has xxx new homes coming forward over the next 10 years before the Heygate development is due to complete in 2025. Any further increase in sales values will be converted directly into Lend Lease profit. Despite recommendations from the DVS, there is no effective review mechanism in the planning permission that will allow the affordable housing contribution to benefit from any improved viability of the scheme.       

## Overestimations
VA shows financing costs are high. But rather than borrowing, Lend Lease has admitted that it's financing the scheme itself. Vertical model, and Last year it sold its stake in Greenwich and announced it would be investing the £100m receipt into its Elephant and Castle scheme. 



The viability assessment enabled LL to forgo the payment of £90 worth of affordable housing(10%).

## leaseholders
As part of the process, the viability assessment needed to assess the existing use value of the Heygate site. This included a valuation of the existing homes on the estate. 

## Pessimistic forecast
Lend Lease estimated that property prices would increase by xx% each year - they have actually risen 37% in Southwark since the viability assessment was submitted. 


<h2>Balance Sheet</h2>
It also has to be borne in mind that it has lost 1,000 council houses and has displaced 179 leaseholders. Most of the affordable housing it is getting in return is not affordable and is getting just 79 social rented units. 

The viability assessment is a long and complicated document and they said we were too dum to understand it, but we have many sympathetic friends with the knowledge to understand it and we will be reporting on their views. 

Watch this space!

A section of the viability assessment provides a valuation of the leasehold properties on the estate.

Factsheet:
1.In 1998, Southwark carried out an 'options appraisal study' looking at different options for the Heygate estate. The study recommended the demolition of some of the estate's perimeter blocks and refurbishment of remaining buildings on the estate. Southwark rejected this on the grounds that full demolition would'enable it to realise the land value'.

1. All new developments at Elephant's regeneration were originally supposed to have fifty percent affordable housing (issuu). This would have provided the new Heygate with 600 new social rented homes, instead we are getting just 79.
