After three years of appeals by Southwark Council & development partner Lend Lease, Adrian Glasspool has finally received the viability assessment for the Heygate outline masterplan in response to his [May 2012 FOI/EIR request](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/viability_assessment_for_plannin?unfold=1). Southwark had initially rejected his request and appealed after his subsequent complaint to the Information Commissioner had been [upheld](http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2013/fer_0461281.ashx). A long battle through the Tribunal system then culminated in a 6 day [hearing](http://35percent.org/blog/2014/02/11/heygate-tribunal-hearing-extended/) in February last year, followed by a [decision notice](http://heygate.github.io/img/FirstTierDecisionHeygate.pdf) directing Southwark to release the assessment minus some of its financial modelling figures[^1]. Following a further dispute about which figures were allowed to be withheld, the Tribunal reconvened and issued a [final decision](http://www.informationtribunal.gov.uk/DBFiles/Decision/i1505/London%20Borough%20of%20Southwark%20EA.2013.0162%20%2810.3.15%29%202nd%20Decision.pdf) in March this year. The Heygate case has since triggered decisions to disclose viability information for other large regeneration schemes including [Earls Court regeneration](http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2013/fer_0491596.ashx) and [Greenwich Peninsula](http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2014/fer_0524770.pdf). 

As well as the viability assessment, the 35% campaign has also received a heavily redacted copy of the District Valuer Service appraisal of the viability assessment, commissioned by Southwark council.  

## First impressions
1. Profitability assessment- not viability assessment
Lend Lease commissioned Savills to produce the viability assessment and it is clear from the disclosed information that __unviable doesn't mean unprofitable.__ Savills tested to see how the development could provide an 'acceptable' level of return (i.e. profit margin) - and sets the level of affordable housing accordingly.
 
2. 25% is the acceptable level of profit
Savills settled on 25% as an acceptable level of profit and the minimum needed to test the viability of the scheme - 'the viability benchmark'.

No explanation is given as to why 25% profit was used as the benchmark, rather than the 20% profit on cost Lend Lease and Southwark had negotiated in the Regeneration Partnership Agreement[^2], but Savills does say this:

The DVS was not impressed with this explanation. __ _"I do not adopt the profit benchmark that Savills have adopted.."_ __

He goes on:

Nonetheless, the 25% figure (equivalent to approx £300m[^4]) was used as the benchmark.

This does not mean that Lend Lease will make any more profit than the 20% agreed in the Regeneration Agreement (in cash terms ca. £250m)[^4], but it does inflate the projected development costs and allow the consequent reduction of affordable housing, to meet the higher benchmark figure and in the event the number of social rented units was reduced from the 432[^3] required by policy [to just 74](/affordable-housing) and the total number of 'affordable' homes to 603 units. 

At the Tribunal hearing council officers acknowledged that they did not actually see the assessment themselves, but depended entirely upon the DVS. He said that 25% profit was too high and the Regeneration Agreement has 20% so why did Southwark allow 25% to be used?



3. Residential sales prices were underestimated

An important part of the viability assessment is the anticipated sales prices of the new homes. If this is underestimated it reduces the amount of money that could be used for affordable housing. Savills estimated to sell at an average of £600 per sqft. The actual sales values are now readily available. A quick trip to Lend Lease's marketing showroom [pic] is enough to find out homes in 'West Grove'- the latest phase of 'Elephant Park' (aka The new Heygate) are selling for an average of just over £1,000 per sqft. If we multiply this against the net internal area of the whole development, we get the staggering figure of £..

The DVS was alive to the probability of an escalation in sales values, so he recommended a 'review mechanism'. He recognised that a relatively small improvement in sales values has a __ _"significant impact on the profitability and this underlines the need to have a review mechanism."_ __(ref).

Southwark however, did not think it worth their while. The [officer's report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!hgyBVuEH%2b8BxXry2bGRAtA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the masterplan application said 

__ _"Given that the development is phased and extends over a prolonged period, it would normally be expected that the viability situation should be reviewed so that in the event of an economic upturn an increased level of affordable housing could be secured. It should however be noted that the indicative viable level of 9.4% indicates that a very significant economic upturn would be required in order to bring the viability to a level of affordable housing above the 25% proposed in this application. Hence it is unlikely (in light of the current viability gap) that a review would secure any increase in the quantum of affordable housing that could be supported by the scheme."_ __  (paras. 153-154)


Southwark council acknowledges that it did not have the expertise nor the experience to appraise the viability assessment. Southwark's Director of Planning said in [evidence] given at the Tribunal __ _"None of the council's planning officers has the expertise to analyse a viability assessment. The council's planning officers refer all viability assessments, without exception, either to the District Valuer Service, or to the council's internal Property Valuation team."_ __(para 41). 

This is why it had to send it to the DVS. It had so little confidence in its own ability to understand the assessment that it did not even open its critical financial model.

__ _"The [financial] model could not be opened as the file was incompatible with the Council's computer systems."_ __(para. 73)

Nonetheless, despite being so dependent on the District Valuer Southwark ignored his criticism of the profit level and ignored his recommendation that there should be a review mechanism. As a result Southwark has lost 358 social rented homes, while Lend Lease stands to make whacking profits.
