After three years of appeals by Southwark Council & development partner Lend Lease, Adrian Glasspool has finally received the Heygate viability assessment in response to his [May 2012 FOI/EIR request](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/viability_assessment_for_plannin?unfold=1). Southwark had initially rejected his request and appealed after his subsequent complaint to the Information Commissioner had been [upheld](http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2013/fer_0461281.ashx). A long battle through the Tribunal system then culminated in a 6 day [hearing](http://35percent.org/blog/2014/02/11/heygate-tribunal-hearing-extended/) in February last year, followed by a [decision notice](http://heygate.github.io/img/FirstTierDecisionHeygate.pdf) directing Southwark to release the assessment minus some of its financial modelling figures[^1]. Following a further dispute about which figures were allowed to be withheld, the Tribunal reconvened and issued a [final decision](http://www.informationtribunal.gov.uk/DBFiles/Decision/i1505/London%20Borough%20of%20Southwark%20EA.2013.0162%20%2810.3.15%29%202nd%20Decision.pdf) in March this year. The Heygate case has since triggered decisions to disclose viability information for other large regeneration schemes including [Earls Court regeneration](http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2013/fer_0491596.ashx) and [Greenwich Peninsula](http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2014/fer_0524770.pdf). 


## First impressions => not a viability but profitability assessment
![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/ViabilityAssessment.png)
The first thing that struck us from the disclosed information is that __unviable doesn't mean unprofitable.__ A viability assessment tests to see if a development provides an 'acceptable' level of developer's return (i.e. profit margin) - not whether it breaks even.
 
This minimum developer's return provides the 'viability benchmark' against which the projected profit is compared. If the projected profit is below the 'viablity benchmark' then affordable housing is reduced until the profit margin increases to the benchmark level. In this case Lend Lease claimed it required 25% profit as its viability benchmark and the number of social rented units were consequently reduced from the 432[^2] required by policy [to just 74](/affordable-housing) as a result. 

What does 25% equate to in cash terms? - according to DVS - ca. £250m.

In justifying its high profit requirement, Lend Lease's Development Director explained in his [Tribunal evidence](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ljlg8vgt2zywied/RobHeasmanLegallyPrivileged%26Confidential.pdf) that __ _"Lend Lease is, of course, a profit-making company and, as a listed company, is responsible to its shareholders"_ __(para 57); and that __ _"if investors do not have confidence that they will earn an adequate rate of return on their investment, the project will not be fundable."_ __(para 58)

The second thing to strike us came when we realised that not only was Lend Lease's 25% profit requirement high, but it was higher than the 20% that had been agreed contractually and we know this from page 83 of the [Regeneration Partnership Agreement](https://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf) which was [accidentally leaked](http://www.newstatesman.com/news/2013/02/southwark-accidentally-leaks-confidential-information) in 2013:

So the question is - how did the council's planning officers fail to pick up on this when the viability assessment was submitted?
The answer is - the planning officers didn't read the viability assessment, they sent it directly to the District Valuer Service (DVS). In his Tribunal evidence, the council's Director of Planning explained that __ _"None of the council's planning officers has the expertise to analyse a viability assessment. The council's planning officers refer all viability assessments, without exception, either to the District Valuer Service, or to the council's internal Property Valuation team."_ __(para 41). 


### Underestimations
Southwark's Director of Planning goes on to explain that the __ _"DVS will interrogate the data"_ __ and in many cases __ _"ask the developer to provide further information to support the projected figures"_ __ but that __ _"council officers will not be directly involved in the discussions"_ __. The DVS will then __ _"provide a report to the council"_ __ but that the __ _"council keeps DVS's report strictly confidential also"_ __.  

We made an FOI/EIR request for a copy of the DVS report and the council provided us with a heavily redacted one, so we don't know exactly what the District Valuer said about the ... . This is now the subject of a referral to the Information Commissioner. But we do know from the Director of Planning's evidence that the __ _"DVS considered that a number of the projections in the viability assessment were too conservative. For example, the projected values of the units in the high-rise blocks were too low"_ __. The DVS report had specifically flagged up Lend Lease's sales projection in the viability assessment as problematic, mainly due to the lack of comparable sales at the Elephant: 

![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/DVSreport_extract.png)

As a result of these concerns and, as confirmed in the Director of Planning's evidence __ _"the DVS suggested that there should be some level of safeguarding by way of a review mechanism linked with delivery."_ __(para 92).

But Southwark ultimately failed to implement this crucial DVS recommendation. Its justification for not doing so is found in the [planning case officer's report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!hgyBVuEH%2b8BxXry2bGRAtA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d). In paragraph 150, it claims that the DVS says 9.4% is viable level and gap is so large that it's not worth including a review mechanism". 

But then we found out that 9.4% was just one of 28 scenarios:

![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/DVS28scenarios.png)

As a result flats that were predicted to sell for £600 per sqft are now selling for an average of £900 per sqft.
Here's link to West Grove Price list: http://heygatewashome.org/img/WestGrove_EP.pdf


{ imgfromappendix12conclusion private values on the site should be 600 - 700 per square foot }

In fact, Lend Lease's viability assessment estimated that its private flats in both high and low-rise blocks would sell for an overall average of £598 per sqft:

{ imgof main report cutout }




Strata achieved £829 per square foot (http://www.colliers.com/~/media/Files/EMEA/UK/research/residential/201202-central-london-residential-market.pdf)

With Lend Lease having sold just 20% of its units so far, it has xxx new homes coming forward over the next 10 years before the Heygate development is due to complete in 2025. Any further increase in sales values will be converted directly into Lend Lease profit. Despite recommendations from the DVS, there is no effective review mechanism in the planning permission that will allow the affordable housing contribution to benefit from any improved viability of the scheme.   




<h2>Balance Sheet</h2>
It also has to be borne in mind that it has lost 1,000 council houses and has displaced 179 leaseholders. Most of the affordable housing it is getting in return is not affordable and is getting just 74 social rented units. 

The viability assessment is a long and complicated document and they said we were too dum to understand it, but we have many sympathetic friends with the knowledge to understand it and we will be reporting on their views. 

Watch this space!

In the meantime here is a short summary of some of the other things we found out from the viability assessment and Tribunal evidence accompanied by a chronology of proceedings.[link to pdf of factsheet]() (add paragraph on 'data room' suggestion)
