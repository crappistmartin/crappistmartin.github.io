## Aylesbury redevelopment - day of decision
![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Aylesburyoutline2.jpg)
The planning applications for the redevelopment of the Aylesbury estate are to be considered by Southwark council's planning commitee on [Thursday evening](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=119&MId=4808&Ver=4). Officers recommend that approval be granted - the report on the outline masterplan application can be found [here](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Vbu5QpckfYCnJrulzlWyuQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d).

We don't have any social rented properties here" (Notting Hill Housing spokesperson).

We previously blogged about the Notting Hill Housing's development at the Bermondsey Spa regeneration 'The Exchange', where the social rented element agreed at the planning committee became affordable rent when - by sleight of hand - social rent was defined in the legal agreement as affordable rent.

 * __ _"We don't have any social rented properties here"_ __ (Notting Hill Housing spokesperson).
Notting Hill has confirmed to local councillors that there indeed is no social rented housing at the Exchange - see quote above - and that the rents charged are affordable rents, ranging from 42% market rent for 3 beds to 63% market rent for the 1 beds (averaging 58% market rents).

The Exchange isn't alone - another Notting Hill Housing development (Elmington estate regeneration) has a definition of social rented housing that allows the same kind of tenure change.

Concern about the same thing happening on the Aylesbury has been amplified by Notting Hill Housing's use of the term 'target rent', which has raised great suspicion amongst local people. On the very eve of the Planning application committee hearing Notting Hill were obliged to send [letters] to all objectors 'clarifying' amongst other things that the term 'target rent' means social rent. Southwark's planning officers agree with this:

However, Notting Hill Housing's [Development Partnership Agreement](http://35percent.org/images/LBS_NHHT_DPAgreement.pdf) for the Aylesbury has no such definiton; 'target rent' is defined with a vague reference to a 'target' and 'formula' set by government, without any reference to the term social rent or the National Rent Regime regulatory framework which governs it. Past planning committees have had the wool pulled over their eyes by Notting Hill Housing. If the same happens again on Thursday the we can add the loss of roughly 1300 social rented units promised by Notting Hill to the 44 units lost at Bermondsey Spa and the 41 units set to be lost on the Elmington estate.
