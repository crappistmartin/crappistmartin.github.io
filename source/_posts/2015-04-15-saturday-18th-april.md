## Elmington
GLA planning report says _"The Edmund Street proposal is intending to provide 192 market homes, 24 intermediate homes, 41 social rented homes and 22 affordable rented homes. This equates to 31.1% affordable housing by unit (all tenures) and 68.8% private, market sale housing. This level of affordable housing is very low for an estate regeneration scheme, and unlikely to be acceptable, even in the context of the Southwark planning policy which requires a minimum of 35% private housing in new developments in this area."_ (Para. 31)

_"A viability appraisal has been submitted to support the proposed level of affordable housing as this is currently being independently assessed to determine whether the proposed level of private housing is required to cross-subsidise the reprovision of affordable housing at 31% and whether there is potential for the site to deliver an increased level of affordable housing. Southwark Council is assessing the viability appraisal in house and the results of this assessment are also awaited at the time of writing, although it is understood that the use of site acquisition cost in the appraisal has been raised as a concern."_ (Para. 32)
