Maybe we should knock on Mr and Mrs Levent's door and ask how much rent they pay?

## Aylesbury estate planning applications to be decided this week

The planning applications for the redevelopment of the Aylesbury estate are to be considered by Southwark council's planning commitee on Thursday. 

## We don't have any social rented properties here" (Notting Hill Housing spokesperson).


We previously blogged about the Notting Hill Housing's development at the Bermondsey Spa regeneration 'The Exchange', where the social rented element agreed at the planning committee became affordable rent when - by sleight of hand - social rent was defined in the legal agreement as affordable rent.

We can confirm that there indeed is no social rented housing at the Exchange - see quote above. We have also learned through local councillors that the rents charged are affordable rents and they range from 42% market rent for 3 beds to 63% market rent for the 1 beds (averaging 58% market rents).

The Exchange isn't alone - another Notting Hill Housing development (Elmington estate regeneration) has had its social rented units changed in the same way.

GLA planning report says _"The Edmund Street proposal is intending to provide 192 market homes, 24 intermediate homes, 41 social rented homes and 22 affordable rented homes. This equates to 31.1% affordable housing by unit (all tenures) and 68.8% private, market sale housing. This level of affordable housing is very low for an estate regeneration scheme, and unlikely to be acceptable, even in the context of the Southwark planning policy which requires a minimum of 35% private housing in new developments in this area."_ (Para. 31)

_"A viability appraisal has been submitted to support the proposed level of affordable housing as this is currently being independently assessed to determine whether the proposed level of private housing is required to cross-subsidise the reprovision of affordable housing at 31% and whether there is potential for the site to deliver an increased level of affordable housing. Southwark Council is assessing the viability appraisal in house and the results of this assessment are also awaited at the time of writing, although it is understood that the use of site acquisition cost in the appraisal has been raised as a concern."_ (Para. 32)

## Aylesbury outline planning application officer's report published
Big reduction in open amenity space justified on grounds that "clearer distinction between public an private realm will result in a clear sense of ownership"..

Looks like all public realm is going to be privately managed:

Confusion over what 'target rent' has been cleared up but it could be 31st July before we know what the legal definition wording is..
