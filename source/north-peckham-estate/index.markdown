A [GLA report](http://legacy.london.gov.uk/mayor/planning_decisions/strategic_dev/dec1802/five_estates_peckham_report.rtf) relating to the North Peckham estate regeneration describes the scheme as follows: 

The North Peckham estate regeneration, also known as Southwark’s Five Estates Peckham Masterplan, was approved as Supplementary Planning Guidance by Southwark Council in April 1995. The five estates are: the Sumner; the North Peckham; the Willowbrook; Gloucester Grove and the Camden estates. Five Estates was one of the major projects that resulted from Peckham Partnerships, the biggest Single Regeneration Budget scheme in the country. The total value of the regeneration programme was £290 million, which included a £60 million grant from the Government's Single Regeneration Budget.

The Five Estates project comprised 3203 homes to be demolished and 2019 to be re-provided in a _"more balanced tenure mix"_. Overall, the masterplan resulted in a net loss of 1184 dwellings.
