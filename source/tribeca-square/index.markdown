The latest Elephant tower has begun to loom over the rubble of the Heygate estate. __Delancey DV4__'s _'Tribeca Square'_ is a suitably absurd name (Tribeca is a neighbourhood in Manhattan) for an absurd development - 270 student studios & 370 private residences for market rent with no affordable housing. Rents are [expected](http://35percent.org/blog/2014/07/19/community-infrastructure-levy/) to be set at around £375pw for a 1-bed and £500pw for a 2-bed.

[{% imgcap right https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CBXYmc6XIAAHGsy.jpg 400 300 Tribeca's prefabricated cladding %}](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CBXYmc6XIAAHGsy.jpg)Tribeca Square is being built entirely using an [offsite prefabricated construction technique](http://www.laingorourke.com/media/news-releases/2015/laing-o-rourke-led-consortium-awarded.aspx) pioneered by Laing (the company that built the Heygate). Even the [bathrooms](http://www.modulor.ae/index.php?page=view_pages_detail&tbl_pages_id=eacf5a7153) are [prefabricated in Dubai](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7609).   
</br>
The Tribeca Square site was public land until 1987, it then housed an industrial estate which was demolished when the land was [sold](/images/LR_DV4Eadon2006.pdf) in 2006 to [Delancey shell company](/images/dv4.pdf) __Eadon Estates__ for £8.5m.

__Delancey DV4__ is a multimillion pound real-estate developer registered in the British Virgin Islands, which has been [accussed](http://35percent.org/images/PrivateEyeNo1311.pdf) of 'aggressive tax avoidance. It is funded by George Soros and managed by [Tory donor](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/party-funding-tory-coffers-benefit-from-fear-of-labour-mansion-tax-9716614.html) Jamie Ritblatt. 

## Planning gain giveaway 
__Eadon Estates__ very quickly secured planning approval after first acquiring the site in 2006. __Eadon Estates__ then [sold](/images/LR_Eadon_2007.pdf) the site to __Eadon Limited__ in 2007 for £18.8m and in December 2008 __Eadon Limited__ went [back](linktoplanningapp) to Southwark's planning committee asking for variations in the site's planning permission.

This included adding 61 private residential units to the revised scheme, reducing the affordable housing to zero and making no payment in-lieu. A viability assessment was submitted to show that the development was not viable without these changes.

The [planning officer's report](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Tribeca_OfficersReport.pdf) recommended approval of the variations, adding for good measure that the council's in-house valuers had confirmed that __ _"the negative effect of on-site social rented housing on the end values of the private units could in this case render the scheme financially unviable"_ __. The report explained that the design implications of providing a __ _"separate entrance for the affordable units would reduce the overall retail provision within the scheme which wouldn't support the planning objective of creating a strong and continuous retail frontage at the base of the towers."_ __
The report also claimed that __ _"it is not possible to show that the value from the additional 61 private residential units produces any additional value"_ __

## Southwark's loss... 
For failing to provide any on-site affordable housing, Delancey should have paid £52.7m under [Southwark's tariff](http://affordable.heroku.com/images/affordablehousingspg.pdf) for in-lieu affordable housing payments[^1]. It offered nothing and Southwark finally settled for a consolatory payment of just £1m[^2]. 

## Delancey's gain...
[{% img left http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/TribecaSquare_VA.png 200 450 %}](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Delancey_Tribeca_ViabilityAssessment.pdf)We show here the confidential [viability assessment](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Delancey_Tribeca_ViabilityAssessment.pdf) Delancey submitted for this application. It states that the completed residential flats would sell for an average of just £525 per square foot. This is well below the £829 per square foot[^3] average sales price achieved by the neighbouring [Strata Tower](http://35percent.org/strata-tower/) development. If we take this as the measure and multiply the difference by Tribeca's total residential square footage (247,079 sqft) we get a staggering £75 million undervaluation.

A different comparison would be against the current sales price of flats on the neighbouring Heygate redevelopment, the cheapest of which is a 1-bed flat [currently on sale](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/new-homes-for-sale/property-48785797.html) for £415,000 giving £967 per sqft; nearly double the Delancey estimate. Multiplying the Heygate/Tribeca difference by the total Tribeca floorspace gives an undervaluation of £109m.

The huge discrepancy between estimated and actual end sales values, might be explained to some extent by rising property values in the (sometimes prolonged) period between planning approval and completion. But even time-adjusted comparisons show that the original estimates for Tribeca Square were extremely pessimistic. The result is that Southwark has lost a great deal of affordable housing and Delancey have made a great deal of profit.


[{% img left http://35percent.org/images/tribeca_cropped.png 300 500 %}](http://35percent.org/images/tribeca_cropped.png)In 2011 __Eadon Estates__ [sold](/images/LandRegistry_TribecaSquare.pdf) the site for £40m to __DV4 Eadon Ltd__ (another Delancey shell company registered in the British Virgin Islands). 

In 2013 former deputy council leader Kim Humphries [resurfaced](http://35percent.org/blog/2013/12/07/kim-humphreys-exit-stage-left/) at the Elephant working for __Delancey__ as an [independent development consultant](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/).

## A remedy?
[{% img right http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/islingtonVASPD.png 200 450 %}](http://www.islington.gov.uk/services/planning/planningpol/pol_supplement/Pages/Development-Viability-Discussion-Paper-and-Questionnaire.aspx)Not every borough is quite such an easy touch as Southwark. Islington Council seems is waking up to the tactics developers use to reduce affordable housing obligations. It has recently produced a [discussion paper](http://www.islington.gov.uk/services/planning/planningpol/pol_supplement/Pages/Development-Viability-Discussion-Paper-and-Questionnaire.aspx) on viability testing, with the aim of producing a Supplementary Planning Document setting out formal guidance later this year. The discussion paper proposes to publish all viability assessments submitted by developers by default. Greenwich Council also [recently announced](http://www.24dash.com/news/housing/2015-05-11-London-borough-to-force-developers-to-make-affordable-housing-viability-studies-fully-public) that it will be publishing all viability assessments. We are calling for Southwark council to follow suit.
