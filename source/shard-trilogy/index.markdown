Developers and architects of the Shard (Sellar/Renzo Piano) are to build a 26-storey tower of 148 luxury flats next door to the Shard. 

Sellar had submitted a viabilty assessment claiming that the on-site provision of affordable housing would render the development unviable and had originally promised to provide the affordable housing off-site on the Wood Dene estate, which is currently being redeveloped by Notting Hill Housing.
 
The [Addendum](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s49912/Addendum%20Report.pdf) for the Shard Trilogy's planning committee report,
says that it was decided that the Wood Dene estate was too far out and that sites will be found closer.

However, the [S106 agreement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!ZXy71ko3venf5X0XMQvpGg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) identifies just 3 sites in the following order of preference:

1. Canada Water Site C&E (Sellar's joint venture with NHHT)

2. NHHT's Manor Place development

3. NHHT's Wood Dene estate regeneration

In March 2015 Savills submitted a land survey on behalf of Sellar, outlining a total of 150 potential sites for the provision of the off-site affordable housing. We have made an EIR request for this land survey and are waiting to hear back from the council.
