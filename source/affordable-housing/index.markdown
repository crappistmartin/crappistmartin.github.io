The following excerpts show how original promises of 50% affordable housing have been progressively reduced to today's level of 0%.:

__0% - Outline Planning Application April 2012:__

{% img /images/planningapphousingstatementfocus.png %}


The planning application for the main Heygate site that was finally submitted in April 2012, contains provision for just 79 social rented homes. The remainder of the so-called 'affordable' housing to [rent](http://affordable.heroku.com/blog/2012/10/20/southwark-council-stuffed-by-lend-lease-again/) will be at the new 'affordable rent' set at a percentage of up to 80% market rent. 

Southwark Council claimed that it would make up for the loss of 1,200 social-rented homes on the Heygate by building replacement social-rented housing on the so-called early-housing sites and on the Heygate footprint. However, the document below shows that this won't happen - only 422 units will be built in the Heygate replacement programme when it is finally completed in 2019. The Heygate footprint should have provided at least 300 new units but this will now provide just 79. The local community is looking at a net loss of approximately 600 social-rented units.

There is also concern that many of the replacement homes that were intended to be for social rent will now be converted to the new 'affordable rent' tenure. This could mean rents of up to £220 per week for a 1-bed flat and £439 per week for a 4-bed flat:

Southwark Council consistently promised that there would be no net loss of social rented housing at the Elephant. These promises have been broken [and at a time when these homes are most needed](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,24899,185,00.htm).


**New Homes for Who?**

The chart below is taken from a report by real-estate experts [Savills](http://www.savills.co.uk/) published in Feb 2012, which confirms that the vast majority of all new-build properties in London are currently bought by overseas investors:

The report states the following:
_"The prime London new build residential market is now being driven almost exclusively by international buyers. As recently as 2009, UK buyers accounted for three-quarters of the prime London new build residential market but, in 2011, almost two-thirds of buyers (63 per cent) were international. At the top end of the market, international buyers were responsible for 88 per cent of all new build sales."_

The new-build developments at the Elephant and Castle are no exception, and are already being marketed abroad and sold off-the-self to overseas investors, before they have even started construction:

The vast majority of these overseas investors are buy-to-let investors. These are mainly property investment companies making investments that will provide them with a lucrative return from the rental income. The developers even actively market the properties as buy-to-let investments:

Southwark's response is that they are planning to encourage the building of Private Rented Sector housing - i.e. those planned for the shopping centre and the Tribeca Square site. These build-to-rent schemes are supposedly going to fill the gap and provide a solution to the housing crisis, but at £375 per week for a 1-bed and £500 per week for a 2-bed, we don't think these will be of any use to the existing population of Southwark. The local average household annual income for the SE17 postcode is just £15,000 (Southwark Housing Requirements Study). 
People from all over the world live in Southwark, many in bad housing conditions. They need the affordable homes that this development could provide. 35% minimum is the only way of ensuring that local people - wherever they are from - can afford to remain living at the Elephant. **35% is the minimum affordable housing requirement for all new developments in Southwark, and we need to let our councillors know that this is not negotiable.**
