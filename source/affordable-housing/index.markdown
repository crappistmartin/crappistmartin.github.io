Here we document with the help of a timeline, how original promises of 500 new social housing units on the redeveloped Heygate estate were reduced over the years to just 82 new homes.

Lend Lease's [outline planning application](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk:8190/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9544643) for the Heygate submitted in April 2012, was accompanied by a viability assessment, which determined affordable housing provision across the 5 phases of the scheme. Lend Lease's [Affordable Housing Statement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!cvj%2buF2v8VRqQhUGaBSuKw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) below shows that of the total 2,469 new homes on its outline site it is providing just 74 social rented homes:

The remainder of the so-called 'affordable' housing element on the redeveloped Heygate, consists either of [unaffordable shared ownership](http://www.thelondoneconomic.com/2015/03/17/trafalgar-place-a-damning-indictment-of-affordable-housing-in-london/) requiring a minimum salary of Â£46,184; or of Boris Johnson's 'affordable rents' of up to 80% market rent. 

1034 Heygate tenants were 'decanted' on the promise that there would be 500 social housing units for those who wished to exercise their 'right to return' to the redeveloped estate. Thanks to a decade of broken promises there will now be just 82 homes to accommodate those who wish to return.
