__185 Park Street__ is a development by Delancey DV4, developers of the [Elephant & Castle shopping centre](/shopping-centre) and [Tribeca Square](/tribeca-square). The development comprises 3 buildings ranging up to 19 storeys in height and providing 163 private residential units.

185 Park Street is located on the south bank of the river nestled between the Tate Modern and the Globe theatre.

To be policy compliant, the development would have needed to provide a minimum of 57 affordable housing units on-site, of which 40 social rented. Instead Delancey has agreed to provide in-kind, in the form of the construction of 56 homes in Southwark Park road combined with an in-lieu payment of £6.5m.

The DVS concluded that the scheme could support affordable housing to the value of £30 million (para 88 of [officer's report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!bK%2f%2fZcg%2fJu4WQWb%2blqILqw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d))

Cost to Delancey is £23.5m so it is making an additional cash contribution of £6.5m.
