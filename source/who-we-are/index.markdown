{% img right /images/elephantamenitylogo.jpg %}We are local residents, traders and others who have an interest in the regeneration of the Elephant & Castle. Many of us are associated with the [Elephant Amenity Network](http://elephantamenity.wordpress.com), which has 3 principles:

1. Open Masterplanning

2. Benefits for All

3. Housing that really is Affordable

We don't believe that the existing regeneration plans are set to benefit all members the local community. Many have either lost our homes or fear for our livelihoods as traders. We don't consider that Southwark Council has competently managed the regeneration process so far. We don't believe that our local councillors - from any of the political parties - have represented our best interests through the regeneration process. 

{% img right /images/spdevent2.jpg %}We have taken part in community events and helped to produce [our own ideas](http://elephantamenity.wordpress.com/2012/02/29/is-the-elephant-your-neighbourhood-summary-report/) and [vision for regeneration](http://elephantamenity.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/visioning-workshop-report/).
</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>

{% img left /images/forestfeast.jpg %} We have supported the [interim uses](http://elephantamenity.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/ean-interim-use-presentation-241111-web.pdf) and activities that have blossomed on the Heygate estate, and have engaged with developers Lend Lease as part of the consultation process for the regeneration.
