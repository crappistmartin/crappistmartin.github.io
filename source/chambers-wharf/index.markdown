Tenure switches from social rent to affordable rent have become routine practice for new developments in Southwark. The arrangement suits both developers and the council, who can [claim the credit](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/100-affordable-homes-open-on-brownfield-site/) for delivering new social rented housing, which is actual fact affordable rent.

We discovered such a tenure switch at __Chambers Wharf__, Berkeley Homes' latest development on Southwark's riverside. In May this year, Councillor Williams [trumpeted](http://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/press-releases/2015/southwark-development-sets-new-standard-for-affordable-housing-in-london) the completion of __ _"106 social rented apartments and 14 social rented family homes,"_ __ which he claimed was proof that the council is __ _"tackling the housing crisis head on and are doing all we can to build the quality affordable homes our residents so desperately need"_ __.  

But What Councillor Williams' press statement didn't say, was that the 89 of the social rented homes had been converted to affordable rents of 65% market rent by [mutual agreement](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=3617) with the council, following a 'viability review' of the scheme in 2013.
