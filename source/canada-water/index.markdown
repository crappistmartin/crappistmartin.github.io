Canada Water regeneration masterplan and area action plan was drawn by [Allies & Morrison](http://www.alliesandmorrison.com/urban-practitioners/), the architecture firm [founded](http://www.brixtonbuzz.com/2015/06/private-eye-picks-up-on-brixton-buzz-story-about-helen-hayes-mp-and-possible-brixton-arches-conflict-of-interest/) by Southwark Councillor and MP Helen Hayes. 

The regeneration comprises four phases on three sites - sites A&B, Sites C&E and sites F&G comprising also Harmsworth Quays:

## Canada Water Sites A&B
{% imgcap left https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CKr8DTiWUAAJn7n.jpg 300 200 %}This first phase of the Canada Water regeneration comprised 9 buildings ranging up to 26 storeys, providing 668 residential units of which 47 are shared ownership and 123 are 'affordable rent' of up to 80% market rent.

The developer was barratts, which has branded the development ['Maple Quays'](http://barrattdevelopments.co.uk/barratt/reports/ar2013/business-review/case-studies/barratt-london-maple-quays.html) and the housing association is

The [planning case report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!vAhB%2bWXWLqfrJmcf89aX8A%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the planning application behind this development, informed the general public and committee members that it would provide 123 __social rented__ homes:

However, when the [section 106 legal agreement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!x3RgHHSbSY10notKcDq0rQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) was drawn up, there was no mention of social rented housing - only __'affordable rent'__ (i.e. 80% market rent):

Former Cabinet member for Regeneration Fiona Colley was responsible for overseeing the delivery of sites A&B delivered. She was so happy with the scheme that she bought (and then sold) no less than two of the new-build flats off-plan[^1].

## Canada Water Sites C & E

{% imgcap http://media.timeout.com/images/101432507/617/347/image.jpg Canada Water Site C - Decathlon site %}

Sites C & E are the footprint of the former Decathlon sports superstore and garden centre behind it. The sites were purchased with extant planning permission by Shard developer Sellar in 2010 for £16m. 

The [extant permission](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=09/AP/1783&system=DC) was for 430 homes of which 74 would be social rented. Southwark council had stood firm on this original application by [insisting](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!CFyLnDePeJAeI7ElqRPpKA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) that the site could support 28% affordable housing at the policy compliant tenure mix (shared ownership/social rented).

[{% img /images/CanadaWaterPlanningStatement.png %}](http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/61507_1.pdf)

[{% imgcap /images/CanadaWaterPreviousMix.png Officer report showing tenure mix for original planning consent %}](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!GZV96J2KIiMY%2fqUIY%2bpvkw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)

Having bought the sites for £16m in 2010, Sellar immediately started [lobbying](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/6436/letter_to_inspector_regarding_sellar_additional_evidence_2_sept_2011) to change the planning policy parameters for the site to increase the density and reduce the affordable housing requirements. 

In 2013 Sellar got his way, and despite [173 objections](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk:8190/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=neighbourComments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9548016) from local residents, was [granted planning permission](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk:8190/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9548016) for 1,046 units of which just 34 would be social rented.

[{% imgcap /images/SiteC_AH.png %}](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!%2b2z4LWWx%2f4b%2bETvBIT0x%2fw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)

[{% imgcap left /images/canadawater.png 300 300 CGI mockup of Sellar's new Site C scheme %}](/images/canadawater.png)Fortunately, the council were savvy enough to negotiate the inclusion of a review mechanism in the [s106 agreement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!cGFmRRD0mjgwvb4DPBAF8w%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for this permission, which would require Sellar to submit viability assessments upon commencement of each phase of the site. Unfortunately they weren't able to negotiate an upwards-only mechanism, so should Sellar be able to prove that a phase is unviable then they can also reduce the affordable housing offer.

3 months after signing the s106 agreement, Sellar [signed an agreement](http://www.costar.co.uk/en/assets/news/2014/March/Sellar-reaches-Canada-Water-agreement-with-Notting-Hill/) with Notting Hill Housing. The agreement put the site under the new ownership of a joint venture shell company created by Sellar and Notting Hill ('__PROJECT LIGHT DEVELOPMENT LIMITED__'). The Land Registry [title register](/images/LR_CanadaWater.pdf) shows the scheme as having been bought by __PROJECT LIGHT DEVELOPMENT__ from Sellar for a staggering £48m - £32m more than the £16m Sellar paid for it 4 years prior. This clever accounting manoeuver inflates the scheme's development cost by inflating the land price, subsequently reducing the viability of the scheme and funds available for affordable housing. 

Despite the planning officer's report clearly stating 'social rented', when it came to drafting the s106 agreement Notting Hill omitted the 'social' from 'social rented', consequently leaving the door open to interpretation as affordable rented. Indeed, in its [press release](http://www.nottinghillhousing.org.uk/about-us/media-centre/news/green-light-for-canada-water-regeneration) and [web page](http://www.nottinghillhousing.org.uk/about-us/media-centre/news/architects-appointed-to-canada-water-development) for the scheme, Notting Hill describes all rented units as 'affordable rent'.

[{% imgcap /images/canadawaterahf.png The s106 legal agreement omits the word social opening the door to 'affordable rent' %}](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!tt5ePcZ7lSQyV67Gq8sTXQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)

## Canada Water Sites F & G - Harmsworth Quays
Sites F & G comprising the former Daily Mail printworks and the Surrey Quays shopping centre site, have not yet been granted planning consent. This monumentous scheme comprising approx 7 million sqft of development across 46 acres, is currently in the early stages of consultation and the process is being managed by 'consultation experts - __Soundings__' (the company which undertook the consultation for the Heygate masterplan on behalf of Lend Lease). The owner and developer of the site C scheme is [__British Land__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Land) - one of the UK's largest developers, formerly run by British property magnate Sir John Ritblatt (father of Delancey's Jamie Ritblatt).

{% imgcap /images/CanadaWaterSiteC.png Canada Water Sites F & G footprint (hatched green and orange) %}

As freehold owner of the entire shopping centre and printworks site, Southwark council initially [said](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/29/southwark-council-daily-mail-print-works) it was going to block the sale of the printworks lease to British Land, but later backed down. 

Initial [consultation plans](http://canadawatermasterplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2158-Canada-water-masterplan-Exhibition.pdf) for site C indicate proposals for around 2,500 new residential homes plus 1,000 new student accommodation units.

The site will also include a new campus for King's College London. King's College is being advised on the scheme by Kim Humphries - former deputy council leader. Kim lost his seat in 2010 and has since founded [__'Carvil Ventures'__](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/), which [offers](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/our-core-services) _"planning advice"_ and _"assistance in the negotiation of s106 agreements"_.  

The consultation plans have so far failed to say how many (if any) of its new residential homes will be affordable and under what tenure. Although a [pre-application consultation document](http://canadawatermasterplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2158-Canada-water-masterplan-Exhibition.pdf) does say:
