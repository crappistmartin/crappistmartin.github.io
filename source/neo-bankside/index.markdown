Our favourite development north of the borough has been [shortlisted](http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/16/stirling-prize-2015-uk-housing-crisis) for the 'Stirling Prize', the UK's most prestigious architecture award. These horrible looking buildings on the doorstep of the Tate Gallery comprising 217 new homes, delivered 0% on-site affordable housing despite being in one of the highest value locations in London. In 2006 developer __Native Land__ successfully argued with the aid of a viability assessment, firstly that the 40% affordable housing requirement was too high - that it could only afford 27.5%, and secondly that it would be better built elsewhere on land that the developer would acquire.[^1]

According to the planning officer's [report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Planning%20Committee/20061114/Agenda/Item%2064%20-%20BanksideIndustrial%20Estate,%20118-122%20Southwark%20Street,%2044%20Holland%20Street&%2047%20Hopton%20Street,%20London,%20SE1%200SW.pdf) for the planning application, this off-site provision would comprise 130 homes of which 94 would be social rented[^2]. 

[{% imgcap center http://35percent.org/images/neobanksideOR.png Paragraph 97 of the planning report for Neo Bankside %}](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Planning%20Committee/20061114/Agenda/Item%2064%20-%20BanksideIndustrial%20Estate,%20118-122%20Southwark%20Street,%2044%20Holland%20Street&%2047%20Hopton%20Street,%20London,%20SE1%200SW.pdf)

But things haven't worked out that way and in March this year Southwark [signed off]((http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!v%2fDXoWcM7JHiLzTujQD8BQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) the affordable housing as delivered, when only 94 affordable homes have been provided by __Native Land__ of which 62 are social rented. The following is our schedule of Neo Bankside's off-site social housing provision (the information comes from the s106 agreements):

{% imgcap center http://35percent.org/images/NeoBankside_Provision.png Schedule of Neo Bankside off-site affordable housing provision %}

## Lost social housing
Despite Southwark's Head of Development Control [insisting](https://twitter.com/interpolitan_1/status/621603023085797376) that all the off-site social housing has been delivered, our subsequent calls to provide a schedule of Neo Bankside's off-site provision have been ignored. The developer has responded by claiming that it has built 132 homes in total of which 82 are social rented. But in doing so has included the affordable housing that was already being provided or was due to be provided by the housing associations delivering the developments on 3 of those sites.[^3] 

So it looks like we can add these 38 homes gone missing from NEO Bankside to the [44 social rented homes lost at Bermondsey Spa](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/southwark-council-probes-44-missing-social-homes/) and wonder how many other developers are failing to deliver the affordable housing, required under the conditions of their planning permissions. We also wonder whether the 62 social rented units are being provided at true social rents, rather than the new 'affordable rents' of up to 80% market rent that we have seen them switched to elswhere.

We also wonder what Southwark is doing about this? It seems that the council has no development control or monitoring procedure to ensure developers comply with their s106 commitments. An audit is required to see how widespread this practice is.

## The public benefits?
With the success of NEO Bankside being so widely trumpeted, it is worth noting that four of the six sites used for off-site provision were council owned sites [sold](http://moderngov.southwarksites.com/documents/s4006/Disposal%20of%20Four%20Sites%20to%20Native%20Land%20Off-site%20Affordable%20Housing.pdf) to __Native Land__ specifically for the purpose. Furthermore, one of these used to site a council-run Children's home and another a council-run day nursery, neither of which are being reprovided. In paragraph 23 of its [planning report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!MThhBTJ0G25rq0%2bkN01Fhg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for demolition of the day nursery, the council justified its decision on the basis of a __ _"review of other nursery services"_ __ in which __ _"it was found that the private and voluntary sectors also provide these services in the area."_ __ As a result, the council declared that __ _"there were sufficient places without the running of the nursery"_ __ and that __ _"the nursery was no longer required and therefore available for disposal"_ __.  

The nursery was subsequently [sold](http://moderngov.southwarksites.com/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=7853) to Native Land for just £975k and the children's home for a mere £900k ([para 13](http://moderngov.southwarksites.com/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=7853)).

## Cooking the books
In 2014, when the council accidentally uploaded it to the [new planning portal](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/485/planning_applications/554/search_for_planning_applications), we managed to obtain a [copy](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/NeoBankside_VA.pdf) of the viability assessment for the Neo Bankside planning application. The document showed that the developer had assumed an incredibly pessimistic estimate for the end sales values of the flats (average £754 per sqft, compared to the actual [sales values achieved](http://www.colliers.com/~/media/Files/EMEA/UK/research/residential/201202-central-london-residential-market.pdf) of £1,326 per sqft).
While most boroughs forward their viability assessments to third-party consultants for appraisal, Southwark chose to do it in-house and in this case the developer's estimates were not questioned by council officers appraising the figures.  

## Viability trumps all
{% img left http://www.my-autoparking.com/photo/pl1100312-hydraulic_drive_automatic_garage_car_stacking_system_smart_car_parking_system_project.jpg 300 200 %}Paragraph 77 of the [officer's report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Planning%20Committee/20061114/Agenda/Item%2064%20-%20BanksideIndustrial%20Estate,%20118-122%20Southwark%20Street,%2044%20Holland%20Street&%2047%20Hopton%20Street,%20London,%20SE1%200SW.pdf), also says that the viability assessment justified an abnormally high number of parking spaces (40% of the flats with parking) in what is supposed to be a car-free development zone. To accommodate this, the Neo Bankside development was built with a [car-stacking apparatus](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk:8190/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?previousCaseUprn=200003376898&previousCaseType=Property&previousKeyVal=_STHWR_PROPLPI_42138_1&activeTab=summary&previousCaseNumber=_STHWR_PROPLPI_42138_1&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9520430) and a two-level car parking basement underneath the site with 87 parking spaces.

## The future
Native Land is also about to start work on its ['Bankside Quarter' scheme](http://35percent.org/ludgate-and-sampson-house) adjoining its Neo Bankside site. Despite the Mayor claiming that 17-18% affordable housing on-site provision was perfectly viable here, this mammoth scheme (comprising 9 towers up to 49 storeys) pulled the same viability assessment trick and persuaded Southwark to accept £65m in-lieu of any affordable housing whatsoever. This pitiful contribution represents just 6.5% of the estimated total end value of the Bankside Quarter scheme (£1bn). We sincerely hope this scheme won't be shortlisted for any awards.

Site 6 was already under construction by housing association __Family Mosaic__ when NEO Bankside intervened with a payment, persuading it to convert some of the homes originally consented as market housing to affordable housing. __Native Land__ has subsequently sought to include these units along with those secured under Family Mosaic's original planning consent within the calculation of its total.
