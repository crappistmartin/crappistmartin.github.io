{% img left /images/leisurecentreaerial.jpg 400 300 %}[__One the Elephant__](http://www.onetheelephant.com/) is a 37 storey, 284 unit residential tower with zero affordable housing, being built by the council's regeneration partner __Lend Lease__ on the site of the former leisure centre.

[Land Registry documents](/images/OneTheElephantRegisterTGL381808.pdf) reveal that Southwark Council sold 1.4 acres of the old leisure centre site to developer _Lend Lease_ for the bargain price of £6.5m. The site will now be home to ['One the Elephant'](http://www.onetheelephant.com) - a 37 storey tower with 4 storey pavillion. _Lend Lease_ also recently acquired the 25-acre Heygate estate site for a [generous £50m](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/elephant-and-castle-estate-revamp-ripped-off-taxpayers-8482794.html).  </br></br>

{% img right /images/onetheelephant.jpg 400 400 %}By way of comparison, the neighbouring and smaller site (1.2acres) of the former London Park Hotel was bought by a government agency [for £17.7m in 2004](/images/360TowerLandRegistry.pdf). New shopping centre owners _Delancey_ [had to pay £40m](http://betterelephant.org/images/OakmayneLandRegistry.pdf) for another neighbouring site (Tribeca Square - 1.5 acres) to property developer _Eadon Ltd_, who thereby made a handsome profit having [bought the land for just £18m](/images/TribecaLR.pdf) from the council in March 2007.

{% img left http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/1354551143_80.177.117.97.jpg 200 300 %}__One the Elephant__ [came under fire](http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/regulation/social-housing-tenants-treated-like-downton-abbey-servants/6529183.article) from London Assembly members in October last year for proposing no affordable housing. Instead Lend Lease proposed a payment of £3.5m[^1] towards the estimated £20m cost[^2] of the new (pint-size) leisure centre. This payment is a fraction of Southwark's [affordable housing policy tariff](/images/affordablehousingspg.pdf), which should have netted it £32m[^3]. The council's [planning report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s32824/Report.pdf) for the development claimed that _"a second  core  would  be  required  to  provide  separate  access,  including  lifts  and circulation  areas,  to  socially  rented  accommodation  within  the  development."_ and that _"not doing  so  would  have  significant  implications  on  the  values  of  the  private  residential properties."_ (para. 37). The cost of the separate entrance for affordable housing thereby justifying the argument that there shouldn't be any at all.

According to its [2013 annual report](http://lendlease2013.reportonline.com.au/annual-report/europe) 61% of Lend Lease's new homes at the Elephant had been pre-sold off plan.
The buoyant sales are undoubtedly due in part to [Lend Lease's sales pitch](http://www.onetheelephant.com/facilities/leisure-centre) that new homes would have a brand new leisure centre on their doorstep.

In Jan 2014, it was [reported](/images/SNleisurecentre.pdf) that council chiefs had ignored the results of a public poll created in order to name the new leisure centre, in favour of a suggestion put forward by Lend Lease.  

In October 2012, government body _Sport for England_ [criticised the council's plans](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6367) to reduce the size of sports facilities at the leisure centre site.

The start of work on [_One the Elephant_](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6463) was marked with some ceremony by developers Lend Lease, including a visit by the mayor of London Boris Johnson. However it was a bit unfortunate for both him and Southwark Council that the symbolically important development has no affordable housing. 

The event was covered by ITV and the BBC:

The TV reports emphasised the lack of affordable housing. Mayor Johnson and Councillor Colley responded with the well-rehearsed defence that _One the Elephant_ was providing a leisure centre instead, and that 1600 'affordable' housing units will be provided elsewhere in the regeneration. As we reported previously, these new 'affordable' units comprise 'affordable' rents of up to 80% market rent and shared ownership homes [requiring a minimum salary](http://35percent.org/images/LQPriceList.pdf) of £57,500 to qualify.
