* In July 2007, Southwark Council valued its 25 acre Heygate site at £150m[^1]. The estate comprised 1,212 council homes of which 179 were leaseholders.

* By Jan 2014, the council had spent £65m emptying the estate[^2] and a further £18m forward-funding its demolition[^3]. 

* A 2012 appraisal study by global architects Gensler showed that the Heygate could be comprehensively refurbished for a total cost of £35m[^4].

    * The 1.5 acre Tribeca Square site was sold for £40m
    * The 0.51 acre Eileen House site was sold for £38m
    * The 3.5 acre Shopping Centre site was sold for £80m

* Southwark argues that it will receive a share of the 'overage' profits when the Heygate development is completed in 2025, but this 'overage' arrangement only applies to profit surpluses after Lend Lease has pocketed a 20% "Priority Return" plus a 2.6% "Management Fee"[^6].

    Furthermore, the amount of 'overage' (if any) is calculated by Lend Lease, which has a track record for accounting disputes over such agreements; in April 2012 it was [fined](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/nyregion/lend-lease-expected-to-admit-to-fraud-scheme.html) $56m for overbilling authorities on a major public works contract in New York; in Dec 2012 it was [sued](http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/valuation-dispute-poses-threat-to-1b-return-from-barangaroo-20121206-2ay9e.html) by city authorities over its calculation of overage on a similar size regeneration scheme in Sydney; and in 2014 it was embroiled in a [High Court battle](http://www.pitcher.com.au/news/lend-lease-decision-impact-property-development-arrangements) with authorities over the terms of a development contract in Northern Australia.

* In Feb 2013, Southwark's Cabinet Member for Regeneration admitted in a local press [article](http://heygate.github.io/img/SNDocumentBlunder7Feb2013.pdf) that _"currently viability tests suggested there was unlikely to be any profit"_ from the Heygate deal. This was further backed up by council's Project Director in Jan 2014, when he confirmed the possibility of _"the council receiving little or nothing from the profit-share provision in the Regeneration Agreement."_[^7]

* In 2014, Lend Lease's Head of International Operations Dan Labbad, who signed the deal with Southwark, [claimed](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/property/lend-leases-international-head-keeps-focus-on-growth-abroad/story-fnko7zi0-1227151774437?nk=08e105b4d18a57454f6a04527dac8fdf) that his company had bought the Elephant and Castle at "the lowest point in the cycle."

* Southwark has argued that it is receiving other cash payments from Lend Lease and this is true, but these are statutory s106 obligations that all developers must pay to mitigate the impact of their development. The Heygate development will provide a £14m [local transport levy](http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/general/news/stories/2011/nov11/171111/171111_3) payment towards the [£160m cost](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5293) of increasing capacity at the Northern Line tube station and a £9m [Mayoral transport levy](https://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/planning/mayoral-community-infrastructure-levy) payment towards Crossrail.[^8]


Despite a policy requirement of 35%, the [Regeneration Agreement](http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf) signed by the council leader in 2010 stipulated that Lend Lease was to provide _"A minimum of 25 per cent Affordable Housing"_(pg 95), which is _"to be divided equally between Social Rented Housing and Intermediate Affordable Housing"_(page 1). However, when the planning application was submitted in Jan 2013, it provided 25% affordable housing but had largely substituted social rent for [affordable rent](http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2014/feb/03/affordable-housing-meaning-rent-social-housing) of up to 80% market on the grounds of financially viability. As a result, of the 2,704 new homes on the Heygate, 198 will be intermediate 'affordable rent', 316 shared ownership and just 82 will be social rented. These 82 social rented homes fall well short of the [500 new homes promised](/affordable-housing/) to Heygate residents who had been offered the 'right to return' to the estate.[^9]

| In November 2014, leaked documents [showed](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/06/luxembourg-tax-files-the-australian-companies-engaged-in-tax-avoidance) Lend Lease to have been channeling funds through Luxembourg and Bermuda, thereby cutting tax rates to below 3%.  |

Tom subsequently left the Council in 2011 to begin employment with Lend Lease, where he is now Development Manager for the Elephant & Castle project.  
Kim Humphries was the deputy council leader and Cabinet member for Housing during the [disastrous Heygate decant](http://youtu.be/E9-cfAdGiFA). After losing his seat in the 2010 elections, Kim [set up shop](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/) as a development consultant helping developers obtain planning permission.  
He is now [working](http://35percent.org/blog/2013/12/07/kim-humphreys-exit-stage-left/) for developers Delancey on their Elephant & Caste [shopping centre development](http://southwarknotes.wordpress.com/tag/kim-humphreys/) and 700 unit [private residential tower](http://www.delancey.com/elephant-&-castle-redevelopment.html) bordering the Heygate site.
