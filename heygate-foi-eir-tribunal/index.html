  <h2>Chronology of Proceedings</h2>

<p><strong>28 March 2012:</strong> Lend Lease submits its outline planning application for the redevelopment of the Heygate estate. The application is accompanied by a viability assessment, justifying that it is unable to support the level of affordable housing required by policy. The affordable housing offer fails to comply with policy requirements on tenure mix (social rent has been substituted by affordable rent) and falls 10% short of the minimum overall level required (35%). According to Southwark&rsquo;s affordable housing tariff, the 10% shortfall equates to Lend Lease being relieved of providing £101.1m worth of affordable housing<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>10 May 2012</strong>: Adrian Glasspool, member of the <a href="http://elephantamenity.wordpress.com">Elephant Amenity Network</a> and one of the last remaining Heygate residents, submits <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/viability_assessment_for_plannin?unfold=1">FOI/EIR request</a> to the council for the viability assessment which accompanied the Heygate outline planning application.</p>

<p><strong>8 June 2012</strong>: Southwark Council rejects Mr Glasspool&rsquo;s request on the <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/viability_assessment_for_plannin?unfold=1">grounds</a> that disclosure <em>&ldquo; would adversely affect the council’s and Lend Lease&rsquo;s economic interests&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>11 June 2012</strong>: Mr Glasspool writes to the council requesting an internal review of its decision to reject the request.</p>

<p><strong>16 August 2012:</strong> The Council&rsquo;s internal review reaffirms its rejection of Mr Glasspool&rsquo;s information request.</p>

<p><strong>19 August 2012:</strong> Mr Glasspool writes to the Information Commissioner to lodge a complaint against Southwark and its refusal to disclose the viability assessment.</p>

<p><strong>26 November 2012:</strong> The Information Commissioner writes to Southwark asking for a copy of the viability assessment to be sent to it within 20 days.</p>

<p><strong>29 January 2013:</strong> After applying for two extensions, Southwark finally responds to the Commissioner saying that a password protected CD Rom has been sent by courier &amp; that two separate passwords would be sent separately by email. Southwark&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zakitwzbkrr4835/LBSICOresponse.pdf">letter</a> states that the Commissioner had been invited to <em>&ldquo;inspect the information at Lend Lease&rsquo;s offices&rdquo;</em>, which the Commissioner declined as he <em>&ldquo;did not feel it appropriate&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p><strong>16 July 2013:</strong> After 6 months of hearing further arguments against disclosure from both Southwark and Lease Lease, The Information Commissioner finally issues a <a href="http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2013/fer_0461281.ashx%20ordering%20Southwark%20to%20disclose%20the%20viability%20assessment%20and%20its%20appendices%20in%20their%20entirety.%20The%20[decision%20notice](http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2013/fer_0461281.ashx">formal decision notice</a> orders disclosure on the grounds that:</p>

<pre><code>* ..there are _"publically reported concerns that the council might not have achieved the best value for public resources in the disposal of its land to Lend Lease"_ (para. 71)
* .._“The Commissioner notes that the scheme will not deliver the level of affordable housing required by the council’s own core strategy. In this respect alone, there is a significant public interest in demonstrating to the public that the council’s decision to progress with the scheme is nevertheless justified.”_ (para. 100)
* .._“With the increasing outsourcing of public services and disposal of public assets to private partners or third parties, the Commissioner considers that there is a growing need for transparency and accountability in authorities’ decision-making and expenditure, not least because many parties which authorities conduct business with will not themselves be subject to the EIR or FOIA.”_ (para. 171)

<p><strong>10 August 2013:</strong> Southwark appeals against the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s decision. In an <a href="http://www.southwarkmagazine.com/news/5171/Borough-to-appeal-Heygate-FOI-order">article</a> for the council&rsquo;s regeneration magazine, Southwark&rsquo;s Cabinet member for Regeneration claims <em>&ldquo;We entered into those negotations with Lend Lease on a confidential basis, and I am not willing to break that agreement because a handful of people wrongly think the document contains something sinister.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>20 August 2013:</strong> Lend Lease writes to the Tribunal applying to become a joint-appellant in the case. The Tribunal [directs] that Lend Lease <em>&ldquo;do not have a right of appeal (that lies only with the parties to whom the Decision Notice was directed)&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>3-7 &amp; 18 February 2014:</strong> The appeal goes before the Information Tribunal, in a <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/02/11/heygate-tribunal-hearing-extended/">hearing</a> which lasts 6 days. The case was heard by Judge Warren and panel members Dr Henry Fitzhugh &amp; Mr Pieter De Waal. Approximately a third of the hearing was in &lsquo;closed session&rsquo; with Mr Glasspool and members of the public excluded from proceedings on the grounds that the disputed information needed to be discussed in detail.</p>

<p>Represting Southwark council was <a href="http://cornerstonebarristers.com/barrister/damien-welfare">Damien Welfare</a> of Cornerstone Chambers. Lend Lease were represented by <a href="http://www.11kbw.com/barristers/profile/timothy-pitt-payne">Timothy Pitt-Payne</a> and <a href="http://www.11kbw.com/barristers/profile/robin-hopkins">Robin Hopkins</a> from 11KBW Chambers. Representing the Information Commissioner was <a href="http://www.monckton.com/barrister/gerry-facenna/">Gerry Facena</a> from Monckton Chambers and representing Mr Glasspool was <a href="http://www.monckton.com/barrister/julianne-kerr-morrison-nee-stevenson/">Julianne Kerr Morrison</a> from Monckton Chambers.</p>

<p><strong>9 May 2014:</strong> After a delay due to illness of one of the panel members, the Tribunal issues its <a href="http://heygatewashome.org/img/FirstTierDecisionHeygate.pdf">decision</a> ordering Southwark to disclose the viability assessment minus the financial model in appendix 22 and the appendices relating to sales estimates for commercial/retail floorspace.</p>

<p><strong>8 Sep 2014:</strong> Mr Glasspool&rsquo;s counsel writes a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9vo3l69bq5mwsao/LD%20to%20Southwark%2008.09.2014.PDF">letter</a> to the Tribunal requesting a hearing because four months have passed and still none of the information has been disclosed. The Tribunal responds by ordering parties to attend a &lsquo;Case Management Hearing&rsquo; on 15th October.</p>

<p><strong>15 October 2014:</strong> During the Case Management Hearing, Judge Warren orders Lend Lease, Southwark and Information Commissioner to meet on 29th October and resolve their differences over a dispute concerning how the Tribunal&rsquo;s May 2014 decision notice should be applied to the disputed information. The Tribunal had previously ruled that the financial model in appendix 22 and the figures related to commercial negotiations for its retail floorspace could be withheld, but there has been a dispute over exactly which of the 22 appendices are related to these. Judge Warren says that if parties are unable to reach agreement then a final hearing will be held.</p>

<p><strong>12 November 2014:</strong> Parties are unable to reach agreement and Judge Warren calls a final hearing for 11th December.</p>

<p><strong>17 November 2014:</strong> Lend Lease responds to the Judge asking for the hearing to be postponed because its Commercial Director is away on business and will be unable to attend.</p>

<p><strong>19 December 2014:</strong> Judge Warren agrees to adjourn the hearing to the 21st January 2015. The hearing will be in closed session attended only by Lend Lease &amp; Southwark&rsquo;s counsel, who will recieve directions as to exactly which of the 22 appendices can be withheld. We are expecting the Tribunal to order the viability assessment be disclosed within a short period after the hearing (barring further appeals and heeldragging by Lend Lease &amp; Southwark). After nearly 3 years of battling for its disclosure, the 35% campaign is looking forward to finally being able to see why Lend Lease &amp; Southwark have been so reluctant to show their sums.</p>
