  </header>
  
  <p>The Elephant &amp; Castle regeneration has been hailed as a global example of sustainable growth. It was declared an &lsquo;Energy Action Area&rsquo; by the GLA and in 2009 it was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8056859.stm">announced</a> as one of 16 worldwide projects <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6032">signed up to the Clinton Climate Positive Development Program</a>, which aims to create &lsquo;carbon zero&rsquo; urban development.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/csh.png">However, the <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/224079_1.pdf">Energy Statement</a> in the planning application submitted by Heygate developer Lend Lease reveals that the &lsquo;zero carbon&rsquo; target has fallen by the wayside. Lend Lease&rsquo;s application proposes to build the new homes just to CSH level 4 - the level 6 &lsquo;zero carbon&rsquo; target has been silently dropped.
 </br>
</br>
 </br>
</br>
</br>
<img class="left" src="/images/musco.jpg"><strong>The &lsquo;Fairly Tale&rsquo; vision</strong><br/>
Furthermore, the original regeneration agreement included plans to provide a <a href="https://www.buildingcentre.co.uk/downloads/underground_london.pdf">Multi-Utility Services Co.</a> (MUSCo) renewable energy plant, which would provide <em>&ldquo;centralised renewable energy generation, where possible using locally derived sources of renewable fuel&rdquo;</em> for all new developments at the Elephant. It was also <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=16241">going to supply</a> the new Aylesbury estate development and the existing Salisbury and Newington housing estates, making it the <a href="/images/muscoarea.png">largest biomass-fuelled district heating network</a> in London. However, the MUSCo plans were eventually dropped from the Lend Lease Regeneration Agreement because the estimated costs were too high. The scheme had become a <em>&lsquo;fairy tale fantasy&rsquo;</em> <a href="(http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5052">according</a> to the Council&rsquo;s own cabinet member for regeneration.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bdunlop.com/images/Elephant-and-Castle/energy_envrnmtl-services_lge.gif"><img src="http://www.bdunlop.com/images/Elephant-and-Castle/energy_envrnmtl-services_lge.gif"></a></p>

<p><strong>The &lsquo;Boiler House&rsquo; Solution</strong><br/>
<img class="right" src="/images/heygateboilerhouse.JPG">Instead of the MUSCo, Lend Lease is building an <em>&lsquo;Energy Centre&rsquo;</em> on the Heygate site, which is essentially a gas-fired boiler supplying just the homes on the Heygate site. This will replace the previous gas-fired boiler on the Heygate, which supplied heat and hot water through a district heating network (DHN) <a href="/images/HeygateDHN.png">to over 2,000 homes</a> on both the Heygate and the neighbouring Salisbury estate. The new district heating network will be smaller and not extend beyond the Heygate footprint - it will not supply the Salisbury estate, and will not be supplying telecoms, potable water, non-potable water, drainage, gas, fibre-optics and vacuum waste as the original MUSCo had planned to. Proposals to supply other estates and developments have been dropped, and all methods of supplying heat and water that rely on renewable sources of energy have been rejected on grounds of their <a href="/blog/2012/07/03/its-all-about-financial-viability/">cost impact on viability</a>.</p>

<p>The implications for the &lsquo;zero carbon&rsquo; objectives are clearly far reaching, but beyond this there is one further complication: Southwark Council has set a planning policy requirement that all new major developments <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/5823/adopted_core_strategy"><em>&ldquo;must achieve a reduction in CO2 of 20% from using on-site or local low and zero carbon sources of energy.&rdquo;</em></a></p>

<p>The originally planned biomass CHP boiler would have met this on-site reneweables requirement several times over. However, Lend Lease&rsquo;s planning application states quite clearly that the <em>&lsquo;impact on commercial viability&rsquo;</em> i.e. the high capital cost of a biomass boiler is the reason that it has been rejected.</p>

<p>Lend Lease acknowledges in its <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/325310_1.pdf">Energy Statement</a> that its application does not currently fulfill this 20% on-site renewable energy requirement: <strong> <em>“11.1.7 The Development does not comply with the aspiration for 20% carbon reduction by renewable energy set out in Strategic Policy 13”</em> </strong>. Lend Lease attempts to mitigate this by promising a few symbolic solar panels totalling around 3% on-site renewable energy (see para. 10.5.5) and claiming that it will seek to source some of its gas from renewable gas sources. It states that one possible future source of renewable gas may be procured from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogas">biomethane</a> plants located off site, which would work in the same way as green electricity currently does. However, the problem is that there is currently only <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11433162">one operational biomethane injection plant</a> in the UK and this has no spare capacity.</p>

<p>We do not believe that the proposed development will contribute towards achieving the sustainability objectives set out in planning policy and the regeneration masterplan. The original vision for &lsquo;carbon zero&rsquo; development in which on-site CO2 emissions are reduced to zero has been abandoned in favour of a different interpretation in which &lsquo;zero carbon&rsquo; means simply that new homes will be more energy efficient than the old ones. The carbon accounting methods also fail to take account of embodied carbon, which is the carbon embodied within the demolished buildings and the entire carbon footprint of materials forming the new buildings and their construction.</p>

<h1>Car-free Development?</h1>

<p>The Elephant &amp; Castle is <a href="http://cycleinjury.co.uk/news/2012/03/08/top-20-londons-most-dangerous-cycling-junctions">officially</a> the most dangerous traffic interchange in London for cyclists. In spite of this, the final masterplan application has dropped all plans to reduce traffic flows at the Elephant and actually proposes to expand the interchange to provide six lanes of traffic. The London Cycling Campaign has made a detailed critique of the plans on its website <a href="http://lcc.org.uk/articles/we-urge-supporters-to-tell-transport-for-london-that-plans-for-elephant-and-castle-fail-to-provide-safe-passage-for-cycling">here</a>.
<img src="http://www.elephantandcastleroundabout.org/pictures/SayNoToTheBodgeatTheElephant.jpg"><br/>
</br>
The current proposals have departed significantly from the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/198503633/EandC-RegenMk1SLRplans">original regeneration plans</a>, which proposed to <em>&ldquo;give priority to pedestrians &amp; cyclists&rdquo;</em> by removing the link road &amp; creating a pedestrianised &lsquo;piazza&rsquo; public square:</p>

<p><img src="/images/piazza.png"></p>

<p>Furthermore, despite the fact that Elephant &amp; Castle has the highest possible rating in terms of public transport accessibility, the Council&rsquo;s regeneration partner <strong>Lend Lease</strong> is building over 700 parking spaces at the Elephant in what was intended to be an entirely car-free scheme<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>:<br/>
<strong>Heygate Outline Site:</strong> 616 parking spaces - see paragraph 15.1.2 of the <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/224093_1.pdf">Transport Statement</a>
<strong>Heygate Phase 1 Site:</strong> 47 parking spaces - see page 11 of the <a href="https://www.iema.net/system/files/phase_one_nts_august_2012.pdf">Environmental Statement</a></br>
<strong>One the Elephant Site:</strong> 46 parking spaces - see paragraph 1.2 of the <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/238287_1.pdf">Transport Statement</a></p>

<p>According to planning officer <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/260032_1.pdf">reports</a>, Lend Lease has submitted viability assessments demonstrating that &ldquo;<em>the proposed level of parking is justified on viability grounds&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/cyclebypass.png">In addition, - <a href="http://halag.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/pdu_2149_heygate_estate_elephant__castle.pdf">despite strong objections from City Hall</a> - Lend Lease has blocked TFL&rsquo;s plans for a much needed eastern cycle bypass as part of the proposed Cycle Superhighway 6 (Penge to the City): <em>“A route for the new cycle superhighway (CS6) is not intended to be provided through the proposed Development. The Proposed development is designed to support leisure cyclists rather than being used as a cycling commuter route through the development which may discourage less confident cyclists and conflict with pedestrian movement.&ldquo;</em><a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/224093_1.pdf">(Transport Statement - paragraph 6.8.2)</a></p>

<h1>London&rsquo;s largest new private park in 70 years</h1>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/elephantpark.JPG">The Heygate estate used to have a sizeable public park (Elephant Park), which was closed in 2011 <a href="http://elephantamenity.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/no-more-football-on-the-elephant-park/">- despite fierce opposition from local residents</a>. Half of the park was subsequently leased by the Council to the neighbouring <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7208">Delancey development</a> for use as a site compound for its construction works. The other half was licensed to Lend Lease for use as a temporary <a href="http://www.theartworks-uk.com/">&lsquo;Box Park&rsquo;</a> and <a href="http://li.zoocdn.com/f580110e0cb4bd7cce1cae252da4301159cb34e4_645_430.jpg">sales showroom</a>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="/images/HeygateCommunityAssetAudit.pdf">this 2002 audit by planning consultant Michael Parkes,</a> the Heygate estate used to comprise a total 24,195 square metres of public amenity open space.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/parkdimensions.png" width="300" height="200">Much fanfare has been made of Lend Lease&rsquo;s plan to create <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/672/final_masterplan_for_heygate_estate_revamp_revealed">central London&rsquo;s largest park in more than 70 years&#8217;</a>. However, according to Lend Lease&rsquo;s <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeResultDetail&amp;TheSystemkey=9544643">planning application</a>, the new park will be just 8,220 square metres in size - representing a net loss of more than two thirds of the site&rsquo;s open amenity space. When probed during the Feb 2013 CPO public inquiry into the scheme, architect <a href="/images/KenShuttleworthCPOevidenceFeb2013.pdf">Ken Shuttleworth said</a> the 70 years reference related to the nearby Geraldine Harmsworth Park (Imperial War Museum) as being the larger park opened in 1934. We did a little research and found that the claim to being central London&rsquo;s largest new park in 70 years is pure fiction and plainly ridiculous. Infact, it&rsquo;s not even the largest new park in Southwark in 70 years - let alone central London: the following Southwark parks are all larger than the one proposed by Lend Lease (0.82H) and have all received park designation since the Geraldine Harmsworth park was opened in 1934:</p>

<pre><code>*Potter's Field  1.35H
*Mint Street Park  .92H
*Leathermarket Gardens 1.15H 
*Tabard Gardens  1.75H
*Dickens Fields  1.20H  
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/224246_1.pdf"><img class="right" src="/images/parkcrosssection.png" width="400" height="300"></a>The <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/254738_1.pdf">planning application</a> also shows that the Heygate development&rsquo;s new park will be just 42m wide (around the same width as New Kent rd), overshadowed by 12-30 storey buildings and hemmed in by a new road servicing the development&rsquo;s <a href="/transport-hub">616 new car-parking spaces</a>:<br/>
</br>
</br>
This is a real kick in the teeth for local residents who can remember the promises of the original regeneration plans. These proposed a sizeable public park and public open space on the site of the Heygate as can be seen from the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/198503633/EandC-RegenMk1SLRplans">original masterplan</a> illustrations:</p>

<p><img src="http://heygate.github.io/img/elephantparkcomparison.png"></p>

<p> However, what is more disconcerting is that the planning application&rsquo;s <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/224077_1.pdf">&lsquo;Estate Management Strategy&rsquo; statement</a> states that the new park - and indeed the entire footprint of the development - is going to be privately owned and privately managed:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The long term regeneration vision is founded on the core principles of place making and central to this is the effective management of the spaces around Plots in addition to effective Plot and building management.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;It is likely that an umbrella Estate Management Company (EMC) will be created, with separate Plot Management Companies responsible for managing each Plot sitting under it. Each Plot will have its own Plot Management Company (PMC). Each PMC will be controlled by the leasehold owners of the new homes, the Registered Provider and the leasehold owners of the retail spaces within the Plot.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The Estate Management Company (EMC) will hold the land on a long leasehold basis from Lend Lease. The Estate Management Company shall be controlled by a main board of directors responsible for managing the company.&rdquo;</em>  
<img class="left" src="/images/emc.png"></p>

<p>The Estate Management Strategy appears to have quite clear ideas of how the behaviour of its residents will be monitored and controlled:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;<strong>7.5 Anti‐Social Behaviour Policy</strong> - The principles set out in the Anti‐Social Behaviour Policy will lay out common standards for the delivery of effective anti‐social behaviour services across the Estate, the Plots and as part of tenancy and leasehold management.&rdquo;</em> </br></p>

<p>The behaviour of non-residents will be monitored by a &lsquo;Town Centre Security Team&rsquo; and as the private owner of the land it will be legally entitled to expel any members of the public indulging in subversive activities like photography or picnicing:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;<strong>8.2 Security</strong> - The EMC and PMCs will have a key role in linking with local agencies, in particular the police, Southwark’s Anti‐Social Behaviour (ASB) services and the town centre security team and the local Community Safety teams.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Further reference to the planned privatisation of the space can be found in the <a href="http://southwark.gov.uk/download/elephant_and_castle_regeneration_agreement_appendix6.pdf">draft illustrative masterplan</a>: <em>&ldquo;To ensure that the high quality external environment is maintained the completed RA site will be managed by its own security, maintanence and cleaning service.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Furthermore, the &lsquo;Play Strategy&rsquo; <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/224082_1.pdf">(in the Landscape Strategy, pg 93)</a> proposes off-site provision of recreational space for older children (i.e over 12) on the basis that on site provision <em>&ldquo;is not considered practical or desirable, in respect to the intended character, use or scale of the space&rdquo;</em>. The picture that emerges is one of a tightly controled privatised space, from which local young people will be actively excluded. This is a contravention of the Equalities Act 2010, which bans discrimination on the basis of age.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://betterelephant.org/images/gatedcommunity.png" width="350" height="493">We have been campaigning to have arrangements here formalised by the Council, in order to avoid the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/11/public-spaces-undemocratic-land-ownership">‘privatised public space’ model</a> – places like More London or New Street Square.</p>

<p>Lend Lease owns the Bluewater retail and leisure centre in Kent, where it has banned shoppers who swear or wear hooded tops or baseball caps. It has also outlawed smoking, leafleting and canvassing on the 240-acre Bluewater site. We don&rsquo;t want Lend Lease to use Bluewater as a blueprint for its Heygate redevelopment. The Mayor of London&rsquo;s 2009 Manifesto for Public Space expresses concern at the <em>&ldquo;growing trend towards the private management of publicly accessible space, where this type of ‘corporatisation occurs, especially in the larger commercial developments, Londoners can feel themselves excluded from parts of their own city.&rdquo;</em> This need not be the case: at the Kings Cross redevelopment it was agreed that the London Borough of Camden will adopt the streets and public areas; unfortunately Southwark has rejected all calls for it to do the same.</p>
