  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="http://cached.imagescaler.hbpl.co.uk/resize/scaleWidth/456/?sURL=http://offlinehbpl.hbpl.co.uk/News/NST/charity-Tribunal-20140514044354391.jpg" width="250" height="140">As reported in our previous blog post, this week saw a second Aylesbury leaseholder fighting the council&rsquo;s controversial compensation valuations at the Upper Lands Tribunal. In buying back homes on the estate the Council has consistently maintained that all leaseholders are given &lsquo;market value&rsquo; in compensation for the loss of their homes. Last week <a href="/blog/2014/05/16/southwark-gives-green-light-to-slum-landlords/">we learned</a> how it arrives at its market value calculation by using illegaly-converted flats as comparable market evidence. This week we learned more about its valuation procedures.</p>

<p>The claimant was a Mrs Olubunmi John, formerly of 28 Wolverton on the Aylesbury estate and now living in the Kent borders. She was represented by <a href="http://www.averyassociatessurveyors.com/">Avery Associates</a> chartered surveyors and a barrister from <a href="http://www.tanfieldchambers.co.uk/Barristers/Stan_Gallagher">Tanfield Chambers</a>. Mrs John&rsquo;s surveyor had originally carried out a survey and valued her 3-storey, 4-bed maisonette at £288,750. In adjusting for market conditions he increased this to £297,500 on the date she and her family had to leave. The council&rsquo;s valuation of Mrs John&rsquo;s home on the day it took possession was just £165,000.</p>

<p>The hearing began with Mrs John&rsquo;s representatives producing a council-commissioned report confirming that the buildings were structurally sound. This quickly defeated earlier unevidenced intimations by the council that the Aylesbury estate&rsquo;s buildings had structural issues.</p>

<p>The barrister then questioned the impartiality of the Southwark council officer who decided on the compensation offer. He pointed out that other boroughs use an independent valuer - somebody from outside the council to decide how much the property is worth. The compensation is then based upon this objective valuation. Southwark Council keep it all &lsquo;in house&rsquo;: they decide their own valuation and then offer that amount as compensation. Most other London Boroughs - <a href="http://sutton.moderngov.co.uk/Data/Strategy%20Committee/20040608/Agenda/$Item%2016.doc.pdf">Sutton</a>,  <a href="http://bit.ly/1pqMVho">Kensington &amp; Chelsea</a>, <a href="http://www.newham.gov.uk/Documents/Environment%20and%20planning/Carpenters%20Estate%20Residents%20Charter.pdf">Newham</a>,
<a href="http://debeauvoircouncillors.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/colville-estate-regeneration-what-is.html">Hackney</a> and Lewisham to name just a few - all rely on valuations from independent external valuers as the basis for their negotiations.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8345/8183341508_e809f1b36f_z.jpg" width="300" height="200">Mrs John&rsquo;s barrister also criticised Southwark Council for using other properties on the Aylesbury also earmarked for demolition as its basis for compensation. He referred to Greenwich Council doing just this on the <a href="http://halag.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/ferrier.pdf">Ferrier estate</a> regeneration in Kidbrooke. The Tribunal there rejected the practice as &lsquo;incestuous&rsquo; when it heard an appeal from a Ferrier leaseholder in 2007 and ordered the use of properties off the estate to be used as comparables when calculating compensation.</p>

<p>The barrister went on to claim that the Council was undervaluing properties on the Aylesbury and that this was demonstrated by the high returns that buy-to-let investors were making on the estate. He showed evidence that the properties were averaging a 13% yield - more than double the current average return on investment for properties in London which stands at around 6%. Using the London average figure and average rents on the Aylesbury to calculate the market value of Mrs John&rsquo;s home gives a figure of around £300,000 - nearly double the council&rsquo;s offer. But even this amount is unlikely to buy her a new home in the swanky new <a href="http://www.albany-place.co.uk">Harvard Gardens</a> - the development replacing her Aylesbury home.</p>

<p>The Lands Tribunal should be there to protect people like Mrs John and her neighbours, including the 130 or so <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/SNWolverton.pdf">elderly leaseholders</a> left on the estate, but the risk of taking on Southwark Council and losing is too high and Southwark Council is taking full of advantage of the fact. One of the first things the new labour administration must do is start offering the estate&rsquo;s leaseholders decent and fair compensation for the loss of their homes.</p>

The event was marketed on the <a href="http://shoreditch.hypeapp.co/shared-events/14034/">&lsquo;Shoreditch Hype&rsquo;</a> website inviting <em>&lsquo;designer-maker&rsquo;</em> or creative businesses to <em>&lsquo;head south for Pop-ups&rsquo;</em> bringing the East London vibe to the Elephant. Prospective tenants were <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/824753570885436/">invited</a> to come and <em>&lsquo;meet the neighbours&rsquo;</em> at the nearly completed container boxpark located the former Elephant Park - formerly designated public open space until its <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2012/07/04/londons-largest-new-private-park-in-70-years">controversial enclosure</a> in 2012.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BouMpuWIAAApjKT.png" width="300" height="200">Among the <a href="http://blog.wearepopup.com/p/viewing-at-the-artworks/">&lsquo;neighbours&rsquo;</a> already booked to move into the boxpark - when it is completed at the end of June - are two pop-up fashion boutiques, a massage and yoga <a href="http://signup.body-align.co.uk/">&lsquo;vitality hub&rsquo;</a>, a Mauritian tearoom where <em>&lsquo;Artists and designers will showcase their products within Qubes that form the walls&rsquo;</em> and a <a href="http://www.southeastcakery.com/">pop-up &lsquo;Brownie Bar&rsquo;</a>. There will be another open day for prospective designer makers and creative businesses on Weds 4th June.</p>

<h3>Doing the Walworth Walk</h3>


<p><a href="http://www.peoplesrepublicofsouthwark.co.uk/images/stories/news/30may201405.PNG"><img class="left" src="http://www.peoplesrepublicofsouthwark.co.uk/images/stories/news/30may201405.PNG" width="300" height="200"></a>Walworth Society and Friends of Burgess Park have joined forces to host a series of free events on Saturday 7th June, under the <em>&lsquo;Walworth Heritage Day&rsquo;</em> umbrella.
The day will kick off with two guided walks around Walworth. The walks (first at 09:30, second one at 10:00) start at La Bodeguita (South American restaurant at the north end of Walworth Road) will criss-cross Walworth Road until they finish at St Peter&rsquo;s Church in Liverpool Grove, approximately two hours later.</p>

<p>From 11:00 - 15:00, St Peter&rsquo;s Church will host the exhibition of the Walworth heritage and an event by Creation Trust:</p>

<p><strong>This is Walworth</strong>, by the Walworth Society, is an exhibition of panoramas of all the shops and historic buildings that make up the Walworth Road and see how it has changed over the past 100 years.</p>

<p><strong>&lsquo;Put it on the map&rsquo;</strong>, by the council-led <a href="http://www.creationtrust.org/">Creation Trust</a> - you will be invited to tell your stories of the area at the Listening Post, see old images of Walworth from Southwark&rsquo;s Local History Library and Archive collection and suggest names of the new streets, blocks and open spaces at <a href="http://www.rightmove.co.uk/developer/branch/Lend-Lease/Elephant-Park-108524.html">Elephant Park</a> (or, as many local people with memory still prefer to call it, the former Heygate estate).</p>

<p>Free refreshments will be provided by the Electric Elephant Cafe at Inspire.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As mentioned in our previous <a href="/blog/2014/05/16/southwark-gives-green-light-to-slum-landlords/">blog post</a>, this week will see a second Aylesbury estate leaseholder taking the council to the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/lands">Lands Tribunal</a> over low valuations following its <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/ObjectionCPOAugust2012.pdf">Compulsory Purchase Order</a> of homeowners on the Wolverton block <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/200179/aylesbury_estate/1965/project_overview/3">(site 7 of the regen)</a>. 59 family maisonettes, a sports pitch and around <a href="http://www.peoplesrepublicofsouthwark.co.uk/hold-news/news/3200-sedan-way-chainsaw-massacre">30 mature trees</a> have been demolished to make way for <a href="http://www.albany-place.co.uk/">&lsquo;Harvard Gardens&rsquo;</a>.
<img class="center" src="/images/Demolition.jpg"></p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.albany-place.co.uk/images/common/harvard-gardens-thumb.jpg">This is the second phase of the Aylesbury regeneration scheme, an L&amp;Q development comprising 147 new homes about which there is <a href="/blog/2014/05/05/manx-connections-the-off-shore-home-of-the-elephants-developers/">concern</a> that the social rented element will be the unaffordable &lsquo;affordable rents&rsquo; of up to 80% market. <br/>
</br>
</br></p>

<p>Former resident, Ms Olubunmi John is the second Aylesbury leaseholder taking the council to court over the low compensation she was paid for her home. Ms John lived with her family at no. 28 Wolverton, a 3-storey, 4-bed maisonette until the council took possession of their home under Compulsory Purchase powers in August 2013.</p>

<p><a href="/images/mrhilmi.jpg"><img class="right" src="/images/mrhilmi.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a>
Ms John and fellow leaseholders <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/SNWolverton.pdf">fought hard</a> for over two years against the council&rsquo;s low valuation offers of compensation for the loss of their homes. Many are elderly and had lived on the block since it was first built in the early 70s. Amongst these was Mr Djevdet Hilmi age 82 (pictured right), who had lived at 36 Wolverton since 1981; he passed away in Jan 2013, just weeks before he was due to appear at a Public Inquiry to contest the Compulsory Purchase Order.</p>

<p>Ms John&rsquo;s property has been independently valued by her RICS qualified surveyor at £288,750; the council&rsquo;s final compensation payment was just £165,000. Much higher compensation is being paid in other regeneration schemes by other boroughs, such as Myatts Fields in Lambeth where Ms John&rsquo;s surevyor has also represented displaced leaseholders.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/fairerfuture.png">The compensation hearing will take place on Tuesday 27th May at the Upper Lands Tribunal in Bedford Square. Substantial legal costs will be incurred by the losing party whoever it is. Why doesn&rsquo;t Southwark Council abide by its own slogan <em>&lsquo;A fairer future for all&rsquo;</em> and pay Ms John a fair price for her home?

<h2>Appealing the appeal?</h2>


<p>What&rsquo;s up with Southwark Council and Lend Lease? After Southwark <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1672/decision_on_heygate_viability_assessment_tribunal">‘broadly welcoming’</a> the <a href="/blog/2014/05/10/foi-appeal-decision/">Tribunal&rsquo;s decision</a> on the Heygate viability assessment, and despite council leader Peter John <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7585">saying</a> that the assessment would show what a good deal 25% affordable housing was, Lend Lease has now asked the Tribunal for more time to respond, as well as more time to decide whether or not to appeal. The Tribunal has responded by giving Southwark and Lend Lease 14 more days until 20th June to come up with the viability assessment and the possibility of appeals still remains open.</p>

<h2>The Elephant forgets</h2>


<p>Retailers, shoppers and users of the Elephant &amp; Castle shopping centre are becoming increasingly apprehensive about its future. New owners Delancey APG have promised consultations on the redevelopment of the site now the local elections are over, so it&rsquo;s useful to look back on the rather dismal history of the shopping centre&rsquo;s previous consultations and a good place to start is this video featuring Dr. Ben Campkin, director of UCL&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/urbanlab">urban lab</a> and author of <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SBMPEA6cJREC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=ben%20campkin%20remaking%20london&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=ben%20campkin%20remaking%20london&amp;f=false">&lsquo;Remaking London&rsquo;</a>.</p>

</center>


<p>Dr Campkin refers to the difficulty of finding the 2005 Ouseley report about allegations of institutional racism in the shopping centre&rsquo;s redevelopment process. We took up the challenge, but it does seem to have dissapeared into Southwark Council&rsquo;s memory hole - despite the fact that there was a <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListMeetings.aspx?CId=194&amp;Year=2005">whole committee</a> set up to respond to it.</p>

<h2>Regeneration goes viral</h2>


<p><img class="right" src="http://i.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/16/1400257660411/Woodberry-Down-new-builds-012.jpg?width=620&height=-&quality=95" width="300" height="200">It is not just us at the Elephant &amp; Castle who are suffering from regeneration. The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/interactive/2014/may/18/public-private-partnership-housing-projects-london-mapped">Guardian map</a> below shows how it is spreading like a rash across the capital. The map was part of a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/may/18/-sp-truth-about-gentrification-how-woodberry-down-became-woodberry-park">major story</a> about the regeneration of Hackney&rsquo;s Woodbury down - a council estate of over 1500 homes. The familiar themes are all there: managed dilapidation, council-sponsored gentrification, financial viability defined by fat developer profits, a net loss of social rented housing and poor compensation for leaseholders, but great opportunities for overseas investors.</p>

<p>Lessons are being learned though and they are being pulled together in the forthcoming <em>&lsquo;Staying Put: an Anti-gentrification Handbook for Council Estates in London&rsquo;</em>, a collaboration between <a href="http://justspace.org.uk/">Just Space</a>, <a href="http://southwarknotes.wordpress.com">Southwark Notes Archives Group</a>, Prof. Loretta Lees and The <a href="http://www.londontenants.org/">London Tenants Federation</a>.</p>

<p>The handbook is designed to help local communities faced with the gentrification of their council estate.  It explains what gentrification is, how communities can resist it and the alternatives to demolition and displacement. It contains ideas, stories and resources gathered from the experiences of tenants, leaseholders and the wider community organising around council estates in London. The handbook will be launched on 12th June - more details to come.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We have written briefly before about the <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/SNWolverton.pdf">Aylesbury estate leaseholders</a> subjected to <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/ObjectionCPOAugust2012.pdf">CPO proceedings</a> and how the council&rsquo;s low valuations of their homes shares similarities with the story of the Heygate&rsquo;s leaseholders.</p>

<p>Former Aylesbury leaseholder Mr Olufemi Joshua, went to the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/lands">Upper Lands Tribunal</a> last week. He was taking Southwark Council to court over the low compensation paid for the loss of his 1-bed flat and he heard some extraordinary admissions from a senior council official.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/comparison.jpg" width="300" height="300">Mr Joshua&rsquo;s barrister first revealed that the flat Southwark had used to estimate Mr Joshua&rsquo;s compensation - by way of comparison - had been illegally converted from a 1-bed into a 4-bed flat. Southwark&rsquo;s officer responded that this quite often happened and that rogue landlords could reasonably expect not to be discovered. He explained that he had used the illegally-converted flat&rsquo;s rental income as the basis for calculating Mr Joshua&rsquo;s compensation. Mr Joshua&rsquo;s 1-bed (but legal) property could not raise as much rent as the 4-bed (illegal) property, so therefore Mr J was entitled to less compensation. The council officer had used the illegally-converted flat unwittingly in assessing Mr J&rsquo;s compensation, but nonetheless defended the valuation. He also referred to another illegally-converted 1-bed property (98 Taplow) and his opinion was that investor landlords commonly take such risks.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The income potential [of the leaseholder&#8217;s flat] and the way it was laid out at the valuation date doesn&#8217;t give the same potential as 109 Wendover - that property having been reconfigured or converted to form additional rooms.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Council official explaining how an Aylesbury leaseholder could have got more compensation by illegally converting his flat</strong> <cite>Lands Tribunal 14/05/14</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Mr Olufemi Joshua, formerly of 252 Bradenham on the Aylesbury - and now displaced to Grays - had first been offered £65k, which was later raised to £85k before the Tribunal. Mr Joshua&rsquo;s surveyor had valued his home significantly higher at £146k.</p>

<p>The illegally-converted flat (no. 109 Wendover) used for the comparison had been sold at a Savills auction in March 2013. This was around the date that Mr J left his home and so was used as a suitable &lsquo;comparable&rsquo; despite having 4 bedrooms. The <a href="http://www.eigroup.co.uk/files/55/18813/f6bc9070-cf2d-4b15-83a0-9809ff36322c.pdf">auction particulars</a> describe the property as a 4 bed flat currently rented out at £300 per week.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.eigroup.co.uk/files/55/18813/f6bc9070-cf2d-4b15-83a0-9809ff36322c.pdf"><img src="/images/auctionparticulars.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Mr Joshua&rsquo;s surveyor presented the floor plan of the illegal flat to the Tribunal, and explained that whilst internal layouts differed, the properties were identical in overall size. He showed how rudimentary plasterboard had been used to divide the rooms, two of which were not much longer than a single mattress.</p>

<p>Mr Joshua&rsquo;s surveyor went on to claim that the council&rsquo;s valuation of the converted property as a 4-bed flat was improper, not least because it hadn&rsquo;t been registered for council tax as a 4-bed. He further pointed out that the conversion falls foul of the Housing Act&rsquo;s regulations on overcrowding and that the kitchen, bathroom and two of the newly-created bedrooms are all well below council and statutory requirements on minimum room sizes. He highlighted that the illegal conversion is also a breach of the council&rsquo;s leasehold agreement, its planning regulations and its HMO &amp; fire safety regulations.</p>

<p></br>
A Land Registry search shows that the illegally-converted 1-bed flat at 98 Taplow was <a href="http://www.auctionhouse.uk.net/london/search-results.aspx?lotid=33522">bought at auction</a> by a <a href="http://www.ourproperty.co.uk/directory/14869.html">property company</a> with a <a href="http://www.blemainfinance.co.uk/">commercial buy-to-let mortgage</a>, after it was reposessed from its original owner when he was declared bankrupt in 2012. The <a href="http://www.auctionhouse.uk.net/london/search-results.aspx?lotid=33522">auction particulars</a> describe 98 Taplow as a 4-bed flat currently being let at £402 per week.</p>

<p>Around 330 leaseholders will have to leave their homes during the Aylesbury&rsquo;s 20-year redevelopment.
The mere fact that the Aylesbury is being knocked down is depressing values on the estate and Southwark shouldn&rsquo;t be using them as a point of comparison for determining market value for compensation. It should also stop using properties that have been illegally converted to maximise rental income, otherwise this could be seen as endorsement and there could be a rush to B&amp;Q to stock up on plasterboard.</p>

<p>Mr Joshua has taken a big risk with his case. Not only will he lose the legal costs he has incurred in mounting the case, but he will also have to pay those of the council should he lose. We sincerely hope that he wins and that remaining leaseholders are not put through the legal torment that he has had to suffer; they should be offered a fair price for their homes, in what is after all a scheme that was intended to benefit residents - not impoverish and displace them.</p>

<p>An audio extract of the hearing can be found on Soundcloud.com at the following url: <a href="http://soundcloud.com/user46375590/lands-tribunal-hearing-14th-may-2014-case-refacq8213-flat-252-bradenham-london-se17-2bg">http://soundcloud.com/user46375590/lands-tribunal-hearing-14th-may-2014-case-refacq8213-flat-252-bradenham-london-se17-2bg</a></p>

<p>The decision notice for Mr Joshua&rsquo;s case is due to be issued in 3-4 months and a second Aylesbury case is due to be heard on 27th May (ref: 28 Wolverton ACQ/100/13).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="http://www.burtonmail.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client%20Images/Client00004/00455000/00455204.jpg" width="210" height="150">The 35% campaign welcomes the latest - and hopefully final - decision in the battle to make the Heygate viability assessment public. The Information Tribunal has <a href="http://www.informationtribunal.gov.uk/DBFiles/Decision/i1279/London%20Borough%20of%20Southwark%20EA.2013.0162%20%2809.05.14%29.pdf">directed</a> that the whole viability assessment be made public, apart from developer Lend Lease&rsquo;s bespoke development model in the assessment&rsquo;s final appendix and the calculations concerning retail &amp; office space - all other information has to be disclosed. Lend Lease and Southwark have been given 28 days to supply the information Commmissioner with the information as outlined by the Tribunal&rsquo;s decision notice. All parties may appeal the decision but only on a point of law.</p>

<p>Southwark Council has released a <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1672/decision_on_heygate_viability_assessment_tribunal">press statement</a> also welcoming the decision. This is surprising because the FOI request for the assessment was made over two years ago and the Council has since fought tooth and nail to keep the viability asssessment secret. Southwark also misunderstands the Tribunal&rsquo;s decision notice when it claims that the Tribunal feared developers would simply refuse to work with councils. The Tribunal&rsquo;s view on this was clearly stated:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are doubtful of the claimed “knock on effects” of disclosure in this case. We had evidence that Lend Lease had changed the way it gave access to data as a result of the decision – but no evidence of any project having been put in jeopardy by the ICO’s decision taken some six months ago.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Tribunal Decision Notice</strong> <cite>Paragraph 43</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p><img class="left" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/2/1299076218162/Scales-of-Justice-007.jpg" width="200" height="100">Southwark Council was supported in its appeal by Lend Lease, who paid a significant proportion of the money that the council has spent fighting the appeal against the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s decision.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://hyperbolegames.com/files/2013/10/PublicInformationHelmetStickerHH0039.gif" width="150" height="150">The viability assessment enabled Lend Lease to build less affordable housing than required by planning policy. The public should now be able to see whether Southwark&rsquo;s decision to waive policy requirements was justified. It was claimed at the planning committee meeting that just 9.4% affordable housing was viable. Only 79 social-rented homes will be built on the whole Heygate development - approx 3% of the total.</p>

<p><a href="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/29/1340999473946/David-Simonds-London-prop-001.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/29/1340999473946/David-Simonds-London-prop-001.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a>The Heygate decision puts the balance of public interest with local people. Their right to information that enables them to take part in the planning process has been found to outweigh the developer&rsquo;s interest in keeping information confidential.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;the importance, in this particular project, of local people having access to information to allow them to participate in the planning process outweighs the public interest in maintaining the remaining rights of Lend Lease&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Tribunal Decision Notice</strong> <cite>Paragraph 58</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>We will be writing more about this as we digest the decision and what it means for housing campaign groups such as those at Greenwich Peninsula and Earls Court, which have also succeeded in obtaining the <a href="http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2013/fer_0491596.ashx">information commissioner&rsquo;s support</a> for disclosing viability assessments. This is a trend that we will be encouraging other campaign groups to follow.</p>

Further research as a follow-up to our <a href="/blog/2014/04/15/the-elephants-new-ivory-towers/">previous blog post</a> has uncovered some unexpected connections between the Elephant &amp; Castle and the Isle of Man. The Isle is infamous for two unsavoury practices – <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/datablog/2013/apr/03/uk-companies-controlled-offshore">offshore banking</a> and <a href="http://www.corpun.com/manx.htm">corporal punishment</a>.  Corporal punishment ceased in 1981, but offshore banking remains popular, as does incorporating companies offshore to cane the backside of the British tax authorities.  We have several guilty parties at the Elephant and they include the developers of;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Strata Tower was developed and owned by a SPV(Special Purpose Vehicle) company <a href="/images/RegisterTGL251176.pdf">registered</a> on the Isle of Man. Some of the penthouses are also <a href="/images/StrataPenthouseLRRegister.pdf">registered</a> to a SPV holding company on the Isle of Man.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7208">Tribeca Square</a> site sold to a <a href="/images/TribecaLR.pdf">company</a> based on the Isle of Man.</p></li>
<li><p>Eileen house is developed by a <a href="https://opencorporates.com/companies/im/113350C">company</a> based on the Isle of Man and which also <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/16/london-property-tax-avoidance-offshore">helps its customers</a> avoid stamp duty by setting up SPV&rsquo;s on the Isle to buy the finished flats.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Heygate developer Lend Lease&rsquo;s global corporate structure is too complex for us to see whether it shares its fellow developer&rsquo;s fondness of offshore companies. However, we have found that its development arm - Lend Lease Residential PLC <a href="/images/lendleasefinancialreport.pdf">doesn&rsquo;t pay</a> a penny in UK corporation tax.</p>

<p>Last year Lend Lease UK&rsquo;s parent company in Australia <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MjA0NTA3fENoaWxkSUQ9LTF8VHlwZT0z&amp;t=1">recorded</a> an annual profit of over £300m.</p>

<p>Lend Lease has no inhibitions about profiting from public assets though. As well as the Heygate and <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2014/01/11/flogging-the-elephant">&lsquo;One the Elephant&rsquo;</a> developments - both on public land - it was Lend Lease&rsquo;s development arm which <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/millennium-dome-the-white-elephant-that-learnt-to-fly-8157301.html">bought</a> the Millenium dome plus 150 acres of Greenwich Peninsula for the princely sum of just £1. It <a href="http://www.thelondonmagazine.co.uk/property-experts/expert-opinions/the-olympic-village.html">built the Olympic Village</a> with the help of hundreds of millions in public funding, and has used more former public land for a <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=186950&amp;p=RssLanding&amp;cat=news&amp;id=1888917">£1.3bn scheme</a> at Stratford.</p>

<p>We are about to get into a fresh range of ‘consultations’ for several major developments, including that for the shopping centre, and will no doubt hear the usual claims about the benefits they will bring to the community - the developers have to secure vital planning approvals, after all. The first condition of planning approval should be that the developer will not suck all the financial reward, not just out of the Elephant, but out of the country.</p>

<h2>Aylesbury Regeneration - social rent or affordable rent?</h2>

<p>Southwark Council has just signed up Notting Hill Trust as its development partner for the Aylesbury estate regeneration and this week saw an <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/south-london-housing-estate-that-tony-blair-forgot-set-to-be-rebuilt-9309864.html">article</a> in the Evening Standard praising the regeneration plans for not following the bad example of the Heygate. While we agree that the plans do look better on paper - half of the 3,500 new properties will be ‘affordable’, of which three-quarters will be for social rent – a small alarm bell has been rung by the language used in the regeneration documents to describe the social housing element.
In the <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/279910_1.pdf">legal agreement</a> for the most recent phase of the Aylesbury redevelopment <a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/lq-wins-work-on-next-phase-of-aylesbury-plan/6522708.article">site 7</a>, the definition of &lsquo;social rented&rsquo; worryingly refers to the <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/ourwork/affordable-rent">HCA definition</a> of Boris&rsquo;s &lsquo;affordable rented&rsquo; housing product of up to 80% market rents:<br/>
<img src="/images/wolvertons106SR.png"></p>

<p>Also, there is no reference to the National Rent Regime in site 7&rsquo;s legal agreement. This is the regulatory framework which decides the level of social rents based - among other things - on the average level of income, and it is standard practice for definitions in these legal agreements to include a reference to the National Rent Regime. Below is an example of the wording normally used in a standard legal agreement used for securing social rented housing:<br/>
<img src="/images/heygates106SR.png"></p>

<p>So the worry is – what will the rent be for the new social housing?  A social rent in the Aylesbury’s SE17 area is currently about £115 pw for a 2-bed flat; on the other hand one of  Mr Johnson’s ‘affordable rents would be way beyond this at around £240pw if it were at 80% of market rent.</p>

<h2>FOI appeal update</h2>

<p>Apologies to those who have been following this appeal and were expecting a decision from the Information Tribunal last week. Unfortunately the decision has been delayed once again and is not now expected to be released until the end of May. We will keep you informed as and when we manage to find out more details on this.</p>

<h2>Is there a doctor in the house?</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/doctor.jpg">Regenerations provide homes, jobs, new trees etc but a serious side effect can be self-delusion; symptoms include a tendency to ignore or mangle the facts and wishful thinking.  It can strike anyone after long exposure to the regeneration industry, but those most at risk include councillors, council officers and, unfortunately, architects.
A recent sad case has just come to our attention.  It concerns a Mr P, senior architect and masterplanner of the New Heygate.  The symptoms of his condition are manifested by confusion over numbers, a hazy recollection of past events and an inability to appreciate the effects of his actions on others.
Mr P’s delusions (see here – <a href="http://youtu.be/a-W6wwVj5dA">http://youtu.be/a-W6wwVj5dA</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/vyQyt0T1Iho">http://youtu.be/vyQyt0T1Iho</a>) include the belief that only 800 people were forced of the Heygate estate to make way for his masterplan (it was nearer 3000); that they all moved into new homes on early housing sites (they didn’t because none had been built), that 83% of them agreed to this ‘through the democratic process’ (they didn’t, because here was never any ballot, still usual in democracies); that they can even now return to the New Heygate (they can’t, because Mr P’s new homes  will be too expensive, whether you’re an ex-tenant or ex-leaseholder).
Unfortunately facts are seldom a cure in such serious cases, but these may prevent Mr P’s condition becoming contagious, and we nonetheless remain hopeful for his speedy recovery.</p>

<p></br>
As part of our evidence gathering for the Heygate <a href="/blog/2014/02/11/heygate-tribunal-hearing-extended/">FOI appeal hearing</a>, we undertook some analysis of the planning applications behind the Elephant&rsquo;s new high-rise developments. After sifting through pages of planning documents we managed to extract some key figures and have come up with the following startling results:</p>

<ul>
<li>The six largest developments comprise a total of 4,282 new homes of which just 79 will be social rented.<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></li>
<li>Viability assessments helped developers avoid £265m in off-site affordable housing tariff payments required by policy.</li>
<li>All six developments are situated on former public-owned land.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="/images/interactivemapfigures.pdf"><img src="/images/interactivemapfigures.png"></a></p>

<p>In order to crunch the numbers properly we had to obtain the total number of habitable rooms in each development. This is how the 35% policy requirement is worked out: 35% of the total number of habitable rooms must be affordable and 50% of these must be social rented as per Southwark&rsquo;s <a href="/images/spdpg38.pdf">planning policy requirements</a> at the Elephant. It is worth reiterating that these policy requirements are based on an independent council-commissioned <a href="https://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/1822/southwark_affordable_housing_viability_study">viability study</a> ensuring that this minimum level of affordable housing requirements is indeed viable.</p>

<p>Next we took the number of habitable rooms sorted by type of affordable housing in each development. We subtracted this from the number of each type required by policy and then multiplied it by the Council&rsquo;s off-site affordable housing <a href="/images/affordablehousingspg.pdf">tariff</a> for the Elephant &amp; Castle area. This is the amount a developer must pay if they fail to meet the 35% on-site affordable housing minimum requirement. However, policy also says that this in-lieu payment can further be reduced if the developer submits a viability appraisal pleading viability poverty. Our analysis shows that this loophole has meant a loss to the Council of £265m in off-site tariff payments, in what has become habitual practice by developers not just at the Elephant but across the borough.</p>

<p>Our findings also formed the basis for <a href="/images/35percentFALP.pdf">our response</a> to the Mayor&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/planning/london-plan/draft-further-alterations-to-the-london-plan">draft further alterations to the London Plan</a>.</p>

<h2>FOI Tribunal update</h2>

<p>For those who have been following our FOI appeal updates and are wondering what the Informaton Tribunal&rsquo;s decision on the appeal is, the good news is that there are only 10 more days to wait. The decision was originally delayed due to the judge&rsquo;s ill-health but is now due to be announced on 25th April - watch this space!</p>

<p><font size="1"><p id="footnote-1">[1] Note that our list does not include the Newington Triangle or shopping centre developments (totalling approx 1,500 more homes) - for which there are no planning applications yet submitted, but which have been rumoured not to foresee the inclusion of any social rented homes. </p></font></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/1299150006_80.177.117.97.jpg" width="300" height="200">It was <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7460">announced</a> earlier this month that the Elephant’s 360 tower is in line for yet more public funding. As mentioned in a <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2013/08/10/towering-disgrace">previous blog post</a>, the land for this private development was purchased with £18m of public money back in 2007 to provide key worker housing by English Partnerships, a public housing agency. This all fell through and the development was eventually awarded last summer to developers <a href="http://www.essentialliving.uk.com/developments/360-london/">Essential Living</a> by Mayor Boris Johnson. The 360 Tower is now on the short-list for funding from the government&rsquo;s £1bn build-to-rent scheme, which is designed to help developers build large-scale housing developments specifically for private rent.</p>

<p>Why Essential Living should need help to build homes it will be letting at handsome profit in a booming property market is not clear, particularly when the Tower will not provide any social rented housing (there will be a meagre 29 units of so-called ‘affordable rent’ instead). There will be 159 units for shared ownership, provided without any government grant, but if the developer is getting subsidy instead for its private rented homes then it’s hardly needed. The public purse will be paying for the free-market housing that pays for the affordable housing, which seems to make the developer a bit redundant from our point of view - why bother with the middle man? There is a chance that some money may be recouped on the initial land cost; one of the GLA’s objectives is ‘a land payment at the earliest opportunity representing best value for the GLA but on a partial deferred basis’ – how much this will be remains to be seen; Elephant land values have varied wildly.</p>

<p><strong>TfL - Northern Roundabout Plans</strong></p>

<p>The long-promised public <a href="https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/roads/elephant-and-castle">consultation on TFL&rsquo;s plans</a> for Elephant &amp; Castle&rsquo;s northern roundabout started last week. The new plans have unlocked the delayed development of the shopping centre and the new transport layout will have a critical impact on the Elephant&rsquo;s regeneration. There are critical local voices though - the SOS campaign (Save our Subways) is canvassing local views through this website: <a href="http://elephantandcastleroundabout.org/">http://elephantandcastleroundabout.org/</a></p>

<p>TFL will be holding an exhibition where the public will have an opportunity to view detailed maps of the scheme and speak to its designers.</p>

<p>The exhibition will take place at:Typo Cafe, London College of Communication, Elephant &amp; Castle, London SE1 6SB</p>

<p>Saturday 29 March 11:30 – 15:30</p>

<p>The consultation closes 30 April 2014.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/images/confidential.jpg" width="300" height="200">Following the successful FOI request by Heygate campaigners, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2013/nov/21/earls-court-project-community-benefits-capital-and-counties">Earls Court</a> community activists have also succeeded with their FOI request for disclosure of viability documents behind their local regeneration scheme, which - like the Heygate - has a great absence of truly affordable housing. The Information Commissioner cites the Heygate decision in his <a href="http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2013/fer_0491596.ashx">decision notice</a>.</p>

<p>However, just as at the Elephant, local authority (Kensington &amp; Chelsea) and developer (Capital &amp; Counties Ltd.) have combined together to appeal against the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s decision. The appeal hearing is due to take place at the beginning of June.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.propertyreporter.co.uk/images/slider/1103231_Scales.gif">Meanwhile the sixth and final day&rsquo;s hearing against disclosure of the Heygate Masterplan viability assessment took place on Tuesday. The Tribunal heard arguments from barristers representing Lend Lease &amp; Southwark Council on one side, and the Information Commissioner and ex-Heygate resident Adrian Glasspool on the other.</p>

<p>The differences between the two sides were brought into focus. Lend Lease argued amongst other things that the public interest is best served by protecting its own commercial interests. Southwark pointed to the disruption that it claimed disclosure would bring to the regeneration process. The Information Commissioner robustly defended his decision to order disclosure on the grounds of enabling effective participation in the planning process. Mr Glasspool&rsquo;s barrister emphasised the departures from Southwark Council&rsquo;s own planning policies, not just regarding affordable housing but also car parking.</p>

<h4>Data Lockdown</h4>


<p><img class="right" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/05/07/article-2320579-19A78BC8000005DC-582_634x934.jpg" width="200" height="400">Amongst the interesting facts to come out was that no planning officer had actually seen the viability assessment. This job was given to the District Valuer Service (DVS). Also, Lend Lease no longer shares information with Southwark Council in the same way; it has established a restricted-access &lsquo;data room&rsquo; which admits only selected Southwark Council officers on a need-to-know basis.</p>

<p>Lend Lease also emphasised the Human Rights aspect of its argument: as a legal person it has the right to &lsquo;peaceful enjoyment of its possessions&rsquo; and the unjustified interference with this enjoyment that would be entailed by disclosing the viability assessment. The Information Commissioner robustly rejected this argument.</p>

<p>Southwark offered the argument that the public had ample opportunity to influence the planning decision through the extensive consultation process, and through to the final decisions about the s106 agreement. They also argued that there could be no public interest in disclosing a very hefty and complicated document, which many would simply not be able to understand.</p>

<p><strong>Viability Assessment says NO!</strong><br/>
<img class="right" src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02419/jobs0_3_2419481b.jpg" width="300" height="200">Contrary to Southwark and Lend Lease, Mr Glasspool&rsquo;s barrister made powerful arguments that the public interest lay in allowing the local community full participation in the planning process: the local community had played an extensive part in consultations, but had been thwarted by the use of the viability assessment; its secrecy was an obstacle to understanding how the loss of public benefit promised by the regeneration was justified. She pointed out the dangers of public policy decisions being made when only one side is in full possession of the facts. Lend Lease&rsquo;s answer to any questions about the loss of affordable housing or maintaining a car-free development was simply &ldquo;Viability assessment says no!&rdquo;.<br/>
A decision is expected within around 4 weeks.</p>

<strong>Peabody Triangle - two more faulty towers?</strong><br/>
<img class="left" src="http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/56023043.jpg" width="200" height="200">Peabody Trust held an exhibition of <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7342">plans for its Newington Triangle development</a> last Saturday. The triangle is currently occupied by the Institute of Optometry, parts of Southbank University and the London School of Musical Theatre (pictured). It is nonetheless a development site that has passed to the Peabody Trust from a private developer. Peabody plans to build 550 residential units and a new HQ for themselves. While it is reported that there is going to be 35% affordable housing, more worryingly this might not include any social rented units. We hope this is not the case and Peabody&rsquo;s proposed two towers do not join the Elephant&rsquo;s other <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2013/08/10/towering-disgrace">&lsquo;Towers of Shame&rsquo;</a>), notorious for having no social rented housing. Peabody are the preferred providers of the affordable housing at the recently-approved <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2013/08/10/towering-disgrace">London 360 Tower</a> just around the corner. This has no social-rented housing, just 29 units of so-called &lsquo;affordable rent&rsquo;. <br/>
</br>
<strong>Lend Lease doing well down under</strong> <br/>
<img class="left" src="http://www.oneplanetcommunities.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Barangaroo-waterfront.jpg" width="300" height="200">Lend Lease has just <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/court-ruling-over-barangaroo-may-put-public-works-at-risk-20140107-30fhg.html">won a legal battle</a> against a Sydney public authority. The dispute was about how much Lend Lease would pay in so-called &lsquo;overage&rsquo; or value share payments, which is a kind of surplus profit share agreement - similar to the one we have at the Elephant. The decision has left the Sydney authority short of the money it needs to deliver public benefits it expected in return for handing over the prime public land for private development.</p>

<p>The Barangaroo development has other <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2012/12/09/has-southwark-signed-a-bum-deal-at-the-elephant">familiar elements</a> - it includes the provision of a public park, which looks doubtful now the authority has lost its money, although it does plan to appeal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Information Tribunal latest:</h3>


<p>The scheduled 5 day hearing of Southwark Council’s appeal against the <a href="http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2013/fer_0461281.ashx">Information Commissioner’s order</a> to release the viability assessment for the Heygate redevelopment will now run into a sixth day. The Tribunal will reconvene on the 18 February to hear final submissions from barristers.  The viability assessment details why developers Lend Lease cannot deliver the 35% affordable housing required by Southwark’s housing policy, as well as failing to fulfil other policy objectives such as providing a car-free development.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://thecreativeconsultancy.com/clients/competition-appeal-tribunal/media/steps.jpg" width="300" height="200">The Tribunal has heard arguments from barristers for Lend Lease and Southwark that disclosure would, amongst other things, be in breach of Lend Lease’s human rights and copyright of its intellectual property.  Further, it would give an insight into its business methods and an undeserved advantage to its competitors.  On top of this other developers might be put off doing business with Southwark and other London local authorities, if they saw that a fellow developer’s viability assessment was being laid bare. Concerns were also raised about the impact of disclosure on the viability of the Heygate scheme itself and the potential for delay this might cause. Senior officers from Southwark, Lend Lease and GLA gave evidence in support of the case.</p>

<p>On the other side of the arugment was the Information Commissioner and former Heygate resident Adrian Glasspool (the original requester), who argued that Lend Lease’s plan to build only 71 social rented units and its failure to deliver the minimum 35% affordable housing, had given rise to a great deal of public disquiet, reflected in extensive media comment; it amply justified disclosure of the viability assessment, which weighed heavily in the public interest. Witnesses included members of the Elephant Amenity Network, writer and campaigner George Turner, planning and regeneration expert Dr Bob Colenutt and Cllr Adele Morris of Southwark’s planning committee. Cllr Morris argued that disclosure would save the council from further reputational harm: <strong> <em>“Much has been made of the harm to Lend Lease if this ‘commercially sensitive’ information is made public, however I pointed out that much reputational harm has already been done to the council by keeping this information covered up. The more the council fights to keep it secret, the more suspicious people become.”</em> </strong></p>

<p>Amongst many documents examined by the Tribunal, the planning committee report of 15 January 2013 came under much scrutiny. This report recommending approval of the scheme said that it only became viable at 9.4% affordable housing. It also had an extensive appendix of local objections, focussing not just on the lack of affordable housing but also the over-provision of car-parking and failure to provide any on-site renewable energy.<br/>
It was also revealed that Lend Lease no longer shares information on the finances of the scheme with its development partner Southwark as it had done before the information request, but now provides a ‘data room’ for council officers to visit instead.
The Tribunal reconvenes on 2nd Feb at 2pm - Court 2, <a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Competition+Appeals+Tribunal,+Victoria+House,+Bloomsbury+Place,+WC1A+2EB&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=51.48931,-0.08819&amp;sspn=0.668689,1.234589&amp;hq=Competition+Appeals+Tribunal,+Victoria+House,&amp;hnear=Bloomsbury+Pl,+London+WC1A,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">Competition Appeals Tribunal (Victoria House, Bloomsbury Place, London. WC1A 2EB)</a>.</p>

<h2>Heygate MP1 –  360 new homes, 17 social rented</h2>


<p>Coinciding with the Tribunal hearing was the planning committee hearing for the first of the detailed planning applications under the Heygate masterplan. Approval was waved through for 360 homes - 284 free-market, 55 shared ownership, four affordable rent (at 50% market rent) and 17 social rented.  The seventeen social rented units equals the number of on-street car-parking spaces provided for the new private town houses, to spare their owners the inconvenience of having to use a basement car-park. An additional 69 car parking spaces will be provided in the basement car park for the rest of the development&rsquo;s car owners.
The Elephant with its numerous public transport connections was supposed to be a car-parking free zone and a carbon positive development. Despite this the first detailed application fails to conform with Southwark&rsquo;s requirement for zero car-parking and minimum 20% on-site renewable energy provision.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The 35% Campaign will be giving evidence this week at the 5-day Tribunal hearing for <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/southwark-in-tribunal-fight-to-keep-15bn-heygate-estate-deal-secret-8808759.html">Southwark Council&rsquo;s Appeal</a> against the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s ruling to disclose the Heygate financial viability figures.</p>

<p>We will be supporting the <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2013/07/24/heygate-figures-must-b-be-revealed-information-commissioner">Information Commissioner&rsquo;s decision</a> and giving evidence to show why we think it is important that the figures be disclosed. We will be showing the Tribunal evidence of the original regeneration benefits proposed, and how these have been squeezed or shelved as a result of the confidential viability assessement submitted as part of the Heygate masterplan application.</p>

<p>Examples include the excessive density of the development and the squeezing of London&rsquo;s newest park down to a <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2012/07/04/londons-largest-new-private-park-in-70-years">privately managed landscaped strip</a> overshadowed by 12 storey blocks:<br/>
<a href="/images/MasterplanComparison.jpg"><img src="/images/MasterplanComparison.jpg"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.bdunlop.com/images/Elephant-and-Castle/energy_envrnmtl-services_lge.gif"><img class="right" src="http://www.bdunlop.com/images/Elephant-and-Castle/energy_envrnmtl-services_lge.gif" width="400" height="300"></a> We will be explaining how the green credentials of the scheme have been further compromised by the shelving of the <a href="/images/MasterplanObjectives2010.pdf">proposed MUSCo</a> 100% on-site renewable energy facility, which has been <a href="/blog/2013/10/11/lean/">dropped</a> by Lend Lease in favour of a less costly <a href="http://www.35percent.org/sustainable-development">gas-fired boiler</a>.<br/>
</br></p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.bikehugger.com/images/blog/car_free_suburb.jpg" width="250" height="175">On the back of its viability poverty plea, Lend Lease also managed to secure permission for 616 new parking plots in what was supposed to be a car-free development.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br></p>

<p>More importantly we will be showing how the viability assessment justified reducing affordable housing from 35% to 25%, and was used to substitute so-called &lsquo;affordable rent&rsquo; (at around 50% market) for <a href="/images/se17rents.png">much cheaper</a> social rented tenure. We will also be pointing out how this contradicts Southwark&rsquo;s position in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-24002244">its fight</a> with Boris Johnson against the introduction of affordable rent in the Borough as a whole.</p>

<p>We plan to refer the Tribunal to viability assessments commisioned by the Council, which support the basis of its 35% affordable housing policy at the Elephant<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, and we will be asking Lend Lease why its viability assessment generated such significantly different results.</p>

<p>Finally, we will be pointing out to the Tribunal that the lack of an effective review mechanism for the viability assessment means that any improvement in viability over the scheme&rsquo;s 13 year development period, will end up as higher profits for Lend Lease rather than an increase in the affordable housing that the scheme was supposed to deliver.</p>

<p>Lend Lease claims that the public interest is best served by keeping the viability assessment secret. The information Commissioner believes - and we support him - that the public interest is much served by disclosing the document and opening it up to public scrutiny and debate.</p>

<h2>Apathetic Appellant?</h2>


<p>A <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s42747/Members%20Questions%20Report%20with%20responses.pdf">written question</a> to the Council Leader on how much the Council is spending on the appeal brought the following response in November last year:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The total estimated cost for the appeal is £57,920 plus VAT, of which about £40,250 will be funded by Lend Lease.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Cllr Peter John</strong> <cite>Council Leader - 27th Nov 2013</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>It seems clear to us who is driving this appeal - we think that even the modest amount spent on it by Southwark would be much better spent elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Tribunal hearing is open to the public and will be held at the <a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Competition+Appeals+Tribunal,+Victoria+House,+Bloomsbury+Place,+WC1A+2EB&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=51.48931,-0.08819&amp;sspn=0.668689,1.234589&amp;hq=Competition+Appeals+Tribunal,+Victoria+House,&amp;hnear=Bloomsbury+Pl,+London+WC1A,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">Competition Appeals Tribunal, Victoria House, Bloomsbury Place WC1A 2EB</a> - Monday 3rd through to Friday 7th February, 10:00am - 4:30pm.</p>

<p>Coincidentally the planning application for the first detailed phase of the Heygate masterplan development is being <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=119&amp;MId=4639&amp;Ver=4">heard on Tuesday</a> evening. This is for the so-called MP1 development bordering Wansey St for 360 new homes, of which 76 are &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; homes (55 shared ownership, 17 social rented and 4 affordable rent). The hearing will take place at 6.30pm on Tuesday at Southwark&rsquo;s Tooley street HQ.</p>
