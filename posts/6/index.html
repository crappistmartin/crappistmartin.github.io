  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>East Walworth by-election -</strong>
Labour, Lib Dem and even the Conservative activists have been energetically fighting for votes in the East Walworth ward in the run-up to polling day on Nov 29th.</p>

<p>The candidates&#8217; profiles were <a href="/images/SNCandidates2.png">featured in this week&rsquo;s Southwark News</a>. It is disappointing to see all three candidates toeing their respective party lines on Heygate affordable housing, rather than stating out an independent position: the Conservative says - get the money and spend it elsewhere; the Labour candidate says - it&rsquo;s as good as we can get, fingers crossed it will get better; and the Lib-Dem says - we can get more (but doesn&rsquo;t say how). East Walworth needs to be represented by councillors who are prepared to put the interests of their constituents above party loyalty. The only way we are going to get any more affordable housing out of Lend Lease is by making it plain that their current applications will be rejected at planning committee unless both the level of affordable housing is increased and that rented affordable is at council rent levels. That is the commitment local people are looking for from each of the candidates.</p>

<p><strong>Social rented housing is affordable but not all affordable housing is social rented -</strong>
We are strictly non-partisan so we cannot say which candidate does not yet know the difference between &lsquo;social rented&rsquo; and &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; housing. But they have been telling voters on the doorstep that the Heygate redevelopment will have 25% social rented housing. If only this were the case. As anyone who reads our blog will know, there is a big difference between the two: all social rented is affordable, not all affordable housing is social rented. &lsquo;Affordable rent&rsquo; is the most misleading kind of affordable housing and that is what all the 1-bed and 2-bed flats will be on the new Heygate. According to <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/SN800GBPaffordables2.pdf">recent research by Southwark News</a> £800 per month is what local estate agents estimate will be the affordable rent on Phase one.</p>

<p><strong>Local Election Hustings -</strong>
All the candidates have been invited to a hustings on Tuesday 27th November 7pm at the Crossway Church, New Kent rd. This is a public open meeting where electors get the chance to put their questions directly to the candidates. Topics will include not just the Heygate redevelopment but also East St. market, transport, open space, car parking, cycle routes, sustainability and green spaces. More information will be provided on this in the near future.</p>

<p><strong>Siege of the Elephant -</strong>
Alternatives to the profit-led scheme that Southwark are currently wrestling with, were discussed at a gathering of over 70 local people, housing activists and academics at Pembroke House on Saturday. Amongst many interesting presentations one was from a global architecture, design and consulting firm, who got an honourable mention for the Building Trust&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.buildingtrustinternational.org/homecompetition.html">&lsquo;HOME&rsquo; competition.</a></p>

<p>It shows how the Heygate could have been refurbished at £14,000 per unit and saved the 40,000 tonnes of embodied carbon that is going to be lost through the demolition of the estate.</p>

<p>While the proposal came in for some criticism, we think it is worth serious consideration and its time may yet come.</p>

<p><strong>Council Leader Scrutinised -</strong>
Eight pertinent questions were put to council leader Peter John and Councillor Veronica Ward about the financial viability of the Heygate redevelopment at last week&rsquo;s overview &amp; scrutiny committee meeting.</p>

<p>Amongst them were how much money is Southwark getting out of the regeneration agreement, and how much money is Lend Lease getting?</p>

<p>The committee would also like to know what St. Modwens plans to do with the shopping centre, and how the funding gap for the transport infrastructure is going to be bridged.</p>

<p>Last but not least, what kind of affordable housing was Southwark actually getting out of the deal, and why should it be any less than either the 35% that policy requires or the 25% that the regeneration agreement promises.</p>

<p>Councillor John <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6441">made an interesting comment</a> in his answers, that money paid in-lieu of building on-site affordable housing by other developers[S106 money] might be used to buy homes from Lend Lease to be let as council houses.</p>

<p>Councillor John further commented that <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m told it&rsquo;s not a very cost-effective way of doing things&rdquo;</em> and we can see why. On-site affordable housing is sold at a fixed unit price, much lower than market price. It would hardly make sense to effectively pay Lend Lease not to build affordable housing, using money other developers have given to Southwark because they haven&rsquo;t built any affordable housing either.</p>

<p><strong>Simon Hughes calls for transparency -</strong>
This week&rsquo;s <a href="/images/SNHughesFV.pdf">Southwark News also reported</a> that Simon Hughes has called for the financial viability assessments for the Heygate development to be made public.<br/>
It is becoming clear that these financial documents are critical to the future of the Elephant &amp; Castle redevelopment. The Heygate planning applications were due to go to committee in October, but have now been delayed until January. Such delays are not unusual but they usually mean that the developer and the planning department are in disagreement about a major aspect of the application.</p>

<p>Southwark Council are fully aware of the viability risks and has prudently listed them in its <a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/134246/response/332306/attach/3/E%20C%20Programme%20Risk%20Log%20Oct%202012.pdf">&lsquo;risk register&rsquo;</a>. Lend Lease successfully argued that they could only afford the equivalent of 12 affordable housing units at the St. Mary’s Residential tower block development, instead of the 90 units policy requires (paras 41, 42  officers report, below). This demonstrates their skill in using viability assessments to justify dropping the social benefits of redevelopment schemes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/stmary.png"></p>

<p>Making the financial viabilty assessment public would reassure the local community that this isn&rsquo;t going to happen on the Heygate.</p>

<p><strong>St. Mary&rsquo;s Residential Parties split -</strong>
The narrow approval of the planning application for St. Mary&rsquo;s Residential development revealed differences of opinion amongst the lib dems and labour parties: three labour councillors and two lib dems voted for the application, while two lib dems and one labour councillor voted against.</p>

<p>For - Councillors [Crookshank-Hilton(Lib Dem), Brown(Labour), Ahern(Labour), Dolezal(Labour)]</p>

<p>Against - Councillors [Merrill(Labour), Barber(Lib Dem), Morris(Lib Dem)]</p>

<p>Unlike other committees, the planning committee is not &lsquo;whipped&rsquo;. This means councillors vote on the merits of the proposal as they see them and cannot be directed in their vote by the party machines. It doesn&rsquo;t always happen that way though. So credit to the councillors who voted against.</p>

<p>Following objections to the Heygate Phase 2 outline planning application from the Elephant Amenity Network, developer Lend Lease issued an amendment to its Energy Statement.</p>

<p>The good green news is that there are two Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants proposed within the Energy Centre. These are acknowledged to be highly efficient and are the desired solution for modern energy requirements. The bad news is that CHP will only be meeting just over half of the total heating demand of the new development. The other half will be met by good old-fashioned gas boilers.</p>

<p>Biomethane gas would make this a greener option but the supply is still in doubt. It won&rsquo;t be produced on-site or off-site by Lend Lease. The gas will come from the national grid but will be paid for at a premium biomethane price: a bit like green tariff electricity. Whether you can get biomethane will depend on whether there is enough being injected into the grid. There are currently no operational biomethane plants injecting into the UK gas grid. Despite this, Lend Lease claim that there is a possibility that 15% of the gas supply could be supplied by biomethane by 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Future (Impossible) Connections</strong></p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/energy9.png" width="400" height="400">It is also a big shock to the 35% campaign that there is no guarantee that the Energy Centre on the Phase 2 Heygate development is going to be connected to the Phase 1 development. The separate Phase 1 application proposes having its own Energy Centre - again reliant on gas boilers with CHP providing just half of its total heating requirements. The outline planning application optimistically lists 14 other sites including Phase 1 that could &lsquo;possibly&rsquo; be linked at some future date. But this would only be possible by installing extra plant. However, questions still remain as to whether there is enough room in the Energy Centre for extra plant and who would pay for it.</p>

<p>Let us remember that <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/2270">the fabled &lsquo;MUSCo&rsquo;</a> was going to provide 10,000 homes with renewable energy. It was a pioneering scheme endorsed by Bill Clinton as a global example of &lsquo;carbon zero&rsquo; development. The ambitious plans proposed a biomass CHP plant generating green heat and power from organic waste. It was also going to provide a bore-hole for a green water supply and an automated vacuum waste collection system moving municipal waste through underground tunnels.</p>

<p>Now Lend Lease have submitted applications that propose no on-site renewable energy, and which barely connect one side of the estate with the other.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/images/spd.png"></p>

<p><strong>&lsquo;Fairer Future - Delivering our promises&rsquo;</strong>
This is what is says on the front of the Elephant Castle Supplementary Planning
Document (SPD) - the rules for developers at the Elephant. One of the promises is
that 35% of the new homes will be affordable, half of which will be social rented (<a href="/images/spdpg38.pdf">see here..</a>)</p>

<p>Naive as we are, we think Southwark should be held to this promise - particularly
since it has been made repeatedly over the last 10 years, and made again as
recently as March 2012, in the E&amp;C SPD. This promise was also the major
justification for moving 1200 households, tenants and leaseholders out of their
homes, for demolishing their estate and losing 1200 council homes from the
borough.</p>

<p>Leader of Southwark Council, Cllr Peter John has been busy this week producing
justifications for breaking these promises, which <a href="http://cllrpeterjohn.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/social-housing-at-elephant-castle.html">he describes as &lsquo;utterly unrealistic&rsquo;</a>, despite it being council policy. This has involved a <a href="/images/SHughesSLPOct2012.pdf">war of words</a> with Lib Dem MP, Simon Hughes. The 35% campaign is not interested in the party political battle - all three major parties have been in power at some point over the last 15 years, they all supported the regeneration plans when
they were in power and blamed the other side for its failures when they were not. So they must all take some responsibility for the mess we are in.</p>

<p>Cllr John&rsquo;s administration was however in the hot seat when the crunch came - the deal with developers Lendlease in June 2010, which only secured 25% affordable housing. He is vehement that nothing better could have been obtained and points to an &lsquo;independently verified viability test&rsquo; that showed only 7-8% affordable housing could be built. We can&rsquo;t comment on the validity of this test because several FOI requests to Southwark for viability test information <a href="/blog/2012/07/03/its-all-about-financial-viability/">have been refused</a>. Let&rsquo;s drag this test, and any others, into the light of day so we can judge how accurate they are.</p>

<p>Cllr John has also referred to the cuts in public funding for social rented housing
as another reason for the loss of affordable housing. The 35% campaign
understands that the Heygate site redevelopment was never due to receive public
funding for social rented housing - as it doesn&rsquo;t fulfil the condition of providing more
affordable housing than is being knocked down, so the cuts in public funding, while deplorable have no impact on the current situation.</p>

<p>Inevitably Cllr John also blames the 2008 financial crisis. Well, as we point out
above the E&amp;C SPD, which has the 35% promise, was adopted by Southwark on 20
March 2012, four years after the crisis. It followed a <a href="https://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/1822/southwark_affordable_housing_viability_study">2010 affordable housing viability assessment study</a> commissioned by Southwark from bankers BNP Paribas, which said ‘at least 35%&lsquo; affordable housing at the Elephant was feasible. It is also in the <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/6069/draft_affordable_housing_spd_2011">draft Affordable Housing Policy (June 2011)</a> and the <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/1968/core_strategy_background_papers">Core Strategy (6 April 2011)</a>. Did Cllr John miss these meetings?</p>

<p>We are also sorry to see that Cllr John is muddying the waters by confusing &lsquo;social
rented&rsquo; with &lsquo;affordable rent&rsquo;. The Heygate planning applications clearly distinguish between the two, and on Phase 1 there will only be 8 social rented units, the 3-4 bed units, while the 18 or so 1-2 bed units will be &lsquo;affordable rent&rsquo;. Substituting &lsquo;affordable rent&rsquo; for &lsquo;social rent&rsquo; is a clear breach of the Regeneration Agreement and the difference between them is simple - &lsquo;affordable rent&rsquo; is a lot more expensive. We reproduce our rents table from a previous blog to show the differences in SE17 rents:</p>

<p><img src="/images/se17rents.png"></p>

<p>The <a href="/images/spdpg39.pdf">Elephant &amp; Castle SPD planning policy</a> is clear on the difference between social rent and affordable rent too: <strong>&ldquo;We do not think that the new affordable rent tenure is affordable for
people in housing need in Southwark.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Whilst Cllr John can be applauded for keeping the &lsquo;affordable rent&rsquo; unit rents below the 80%
maximum allowed, this is small comfort for those who still can&rsquo;t afford the £178pw a
1-bed flat would still cost.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/fairerfuture.png">Finally in his blog Cllr John cites other sites across London were the situation is a lot worse (Battersea Power Stn, Tower Hamlet&rsquo;s Wood Wharf, Earl&rsquo;s Court). He then supplies the reason for this - developer power. Developers bully councils with the threat that they will walk away from the scheme and they use their own questionable financial viability assessments to do so. It may be worse elsewhere but to go from 35% to 25%, particularly when much of the 25% is not actually affordable is a loss, not a win. This is not delivering promises and will not make a fairer future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>There is no affordable housing provision within the proposed scheme.</p><footer><strong>Planning Application ref 12/AP/2239</strong> <cite>Housing Statement Paragraph 7.3</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>In their first two detailed planning applications for the Elephant regeneration Lend Lease propose building 8 social rented units out of a total of 519 homes (Heygate Phase 1 - 235 units &amp; St. Mary&rsquo;s Residential - 284 units).</p>

<p>The St. Mary&rsquo;s residential planning application is due to be considered at the planning committee meeting of 6th November and will have no affordable housing of any kind <a href="/images/planningcommittee.png">details here.</a>. Nor will Lend Lease be making any contribution to affordable housing offsite. Instead £3.5m is going towards building the new leisure centre that was dropped from the original Regeneration Agreement. Lend Lease is forcing Southwark to take the contribution towards the new leisure centre in lieu of social housing.</p>

<p>The officer&rsquo;s report reveals two further reasons for Lend Lease ditching affordable and social rented housing: first, it would bring down the value of the private homes; second, Lend Lease want to keep social rented tenants separate from private owners. This would mean building a separate &lsquo;second core&rsquo;, which would be required to provide:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;separate access including lifts and circulation areas to social rented accommodation within the development.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Planning Application ref 12/AP/2239</strong> <cite>Officer&#8217;s Report</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>The cost of this social apartheid makes the scheme financially unviable. Unsurprisingly Lend Lease&rsquo;s solution is not to build any social rented or affordable housing! A more obvious solution would be to have a single access point, a single lift shaft, a single lift for all the tenants and residents of St. Mary&rsquo;s residential. Tenants and residents mix happily on the Newington estate on the Rockingham estate and on every other estate at the Elephant and we don&rsquo;t need Lend Lease introducing residential segregation into our community.</p>

<p>We can now begin to see what vision the developers have for the new Elephant and Castle - one that doesn&rsquo;t include any social tenants.  Strata Tower and Tribeca Sq (Oakmayne Plaza) both got planning permission without social rented homes. If they are joined by St Mary&rsquo;s and Heygate Phase 1 that will be just 8 units out of 1,300.</p>

<h2>East Walworth By-election - a chance for our local politicians to prove where they stand</h2>


<p>The polling date for the East Walworth by-election has just been announced for 29th Nov. This is a chance for the Liberal Democrat and Labour parties to really show how much support they have for affordable housing, by standing candidates who will speak against the Lendlease planning applictions for Heygate Phase 1 and St Mary&rsquo;s Residential. Both applications will be heard soon after the by-election.</p>

<p>The Heygate phase one application has sparked a <a href="/images/SHughesSLPOct2012.pdf">war of words between local MP Simon Hughes and council leader Peter John</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Southwark Council confirmed that there are only going to be 8 social rented units on phase 1 of the Heygate redevelopment, a net loss of 97 social rented units on this part of the Heygate site.</p>

<p>A public meeting last Thursday attended by Simon Hughes MP and council leader Peter John also heard that there will be no 1 or 2 bed social rented units. Instead, development partner Lend Lease has substituted 20 so-called &lsquo;affordable rented&rsquo; units for social rent. The difference in rent each week is around an extra £88 for a 1-bed flat and £105 for a 2-bed flat, making the total rents £178 and £208 per week respectively.</p>

<p>It could have been worse as Councillor John was at pains to point out. The affordable rent is much favoured by the mayor Boris Johnson; he would like to see rents as high as £220 and £256 per week - 80% market rent. Councillor John said he would try to get 50% market rent from Lend Lease. This would bring it into line with phase 2 and would bring rents down to £137 and £160 per week.</p>

<p><img src="/images/se17rents.png"></p>

<p>The 8 social rented units will be 3&amp;4 bed homes.  About 27 more units of all sizes will be part-buy/part-rent.</p>

<p>To summarise, the phase 1 development will double the density of housing to 235 homes while reducing the social rented element to almost zero. The affordable rented housing isn&rsquo;t as expensive as it might have been, but will still be too expensive for anybody that needs a council house.</p>

<p>Phase 2 is not much better. 2,400 homes are going to be built on this site. It will also have no one or two bed social rented homes only affordable rent at 50% market rent. The 3 or 4 bed homes will be social rented. It is impossible to tell from the application just how many affordable homes will be either 1 or 2 bed or 3 or 4 bed, hence how many will be social rent or how many will be affordable rent.</p>

<p>Both these planning applications breach Southwark&rsquo;s affordable housing policy, which requires 35% minimum affordable housing. Southwark justified this on the grounds that its Regeneration Agreement with Lend Lease was going to provide 25% minimum affordable housing, half of which would be social rented. Now we can see that this promise has been broken too.</p>

<p>Councillor Peter John acknowledged the many shortcomings of the application, but couldn&rsquo;t commit to increasing the number of social rented homes, only to bringing the affordable rent down.</p>

<p>Simon Hughes has since <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-20061007">called for the phase 1 planning application to be withdrawn</a> and re-submitted with a revised affordable housing offer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week at the Community Forum for the Elephant Regeneration, Southwark Council rejected a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/119mWpDRAI8FieGAYvKTrSkLQr1ozVp3MBQt2uuo9KEM/edit">proposal from the Elephant Amenity Network</a> that the planning committee meeting deciding on the Heygate Outline Masterplan application (12-AP-1092) should be held over 2 or 3 evenings.</p>

<p>Planning committee meetings in Southwark allocate a total of 3 minutes for all objectors to make their case - so if there are 3 objectors each gets a one minute slot, six objectors get 30 seconds each and so on. There are at least 150 objectors to the <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeDocs&amp;TheSystemkey=9544643">masterplan application</a>.</p>

<p>The chair of the planning committee, Cllr Nick Dolezal and the Head of Development Control, Gary Rice, both argued that this arrangement would be entirely sufficient for objectors to get their views across. While it didn’t give much time for objectors initially, they could rely on the well-briefed committee councillors asking them the right follow-on questions, and so get a fair hearing.</p>

<p>We have our doubts that councillors will be so obliging, and wonder – what are Southwark Council so worried about?</p>

<p>Part of the answer could be the several areas of ‘non-compliance’ in the application identified by the Greater London Authority, chief among them the lack of affordable housing, - ‘The application does not propose any affordable housing provision at present’ para 42 (link to GLA letter 11 July 2012). A revision of the application is said to be imminent and could include a commitment to 25% affordable housing – better than the original application, but still not the 35% Southwark’s affordable housing policy requires. There are also worrying signs that ‘affordable rent’ may replace some or all of the ‘social rented’ provision – a difference in rent of about £240 pw against about £90pw, for a one-bed flat.</p>

<p>The planning committee meeting to decide the application is provisionally set for 27 Nov 2012. Objections to the application, including the preposterous committee meeting arrangements, can be made up to the date of the meeting – email <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#x70;&#x6c;&#97;&#110;&#110;&#105;&#x6e;&#x67;&#46;&#97;&#112;&#112;&#108;&#x69;&#99;&#97;&#116;&#105;&#x6f;&#110;&#x73;&#x40;&#x73;&#111;&#117;&#116;&#x68;&#x77;&#x61;&#x72;&#107;&#46;&#103;&#111;&#118;&#x2e;&#117;&#107;">&#112;&#x6c;&#97;&#110;&#x6e;&#105;&#x6e;&#x67;&#x2e;&#x61;&#x70;&#112;&#108;&#x69;&#x63;&#x61;&#x74;&#x69;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#115;&#64;&#115;&#111;&#117;&#x74;&#104;&#x77;&#97;&#x72;&#x6b;&#46;&#103;&#x6f;&#118;&#x2e;&#117;&#107;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Government has just announced that developers can re-negotiate S106 agreements for so-called stalled development sites. These agreements fund community infrastructure and affordable housing. There are several ways in which this might affect developments at the Elephant &amp; Castle.</p>

<p>The London 360 Tower on the site of the old London Park Hotel was granted planning permission in 2007.  In 2008 the developer &lsquo;First Base&rsquo; - part of the Lend Lease consortium - was granted a variation in the permission, reducing the amount of affordable housing, so that they could ‘crack on with the scheme’.  We’re still waiting for the Tower and the affordable housing, and there is every likelihood that First Base will be back to seek another &lsquo;variation&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The development was backed by the Government regeneration agency English Partnerships which bought the London Park Hotel site for approximately £18 million with the express intention of developing affordable homes for key workers.
The first round of re-negotiations saw the 159 &ldquo;intermediate affordable&rdquo; reduced to 116 units. Social rented homes were increased from 29 to 35, but the number of apartments to be sold on the open market increased from 282 to 319.</p>

<p>At the time, Committee chair Cllr James Gurling noted the &ldquo;dreadful irony&rdquo; of the Government spending £18million on acquiring the site – part of it from Southwark Council – for affordable housing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lot of money has gone round in a big circle and the net losers will be the people who need the help most,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>Stead St is a development of 464 new homes, 90% affordable, built specifically to re-house Heygate estate residents. Planning approval was given just last week. It will be part funded by £1m S106 contribution from the developers of &lsquo;Tribeca Square&rsquo; (Oakmayne Plaza) another Tower at the Elephant. This got planning permission in 2007. Southwark were due to receive the S106 money in two tranches upon &lsquo;implementation&rsquo; but like the 360 Tower, nothing has been built.</p>

<p>Can we expect the owners of the Oakmayne Plaza site to return for their money?</p>

<p>The Heygate footprint should at least secure 25% affordable housing despite the Government&rsquo;s actions. The phase 1 application specifies 25% and Southwark insists that 25% is guaranteed by the Regeneration Agreement despite its absence from the phase 2 Heygate outline masterplan application. Will Lend Lease forgo the opportunity of trying to take advantage of this new policy?</p>

<p>The Government promises £300m to build 15,000 affordable homes as compensation for the loss of S106 funded homes, but it remains to be seen whether any of this will be coming to the Elephant &amp; Castle.</p>

<p>In November 2009, TFL objected to Southwark&rsquo;s Core Strategy on the grounds that it didn&rsquo;t address the shortages in transport capacity at the tube station: <em>&ldquo;Our analysis of public transport facilities at Elephant &amp; Castle has indicated that existing underground connections - particularly the Northern line - are deficient in terms of quality and capacity.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Having carried out an analysis which found that capacity was already at breaking point and that any further capacity would require the installation of escalators and a new ticket hall, it urged the inspector to force Southwark Council to amend the Core Strategy to include the following: <em>&ldquo;This will comprise an improved Northern line station with a new ticket hall and escalators.&rdquo;</em>
www.southwark.gov.uk/download/4755/cdair11_objector_ref_196_gla_tfl_matters_1_2_3_4</p>

<p>Southwark Council was forced to include the amendment and the clause was written into paragraph 4.28 in page 44 of the <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/2648/documents_for_core_strategy_adoption">final adopted Core Strategy</a>.</p>

<p>Cllr. Kim Humphreys - O&amp;S Committee, 3 Nov 2008.
The final major hurdle to signing the agreement is the cost of renovating the
northern line underground station.  We have worked very closely with Lendlease to
negotiate with TfL over the finances of the project and are close to securing the
final details.”</p>

<p>She went on the say that the tube station needs significant investment, around £200 million, and that will need to be realised from the Lend Lease agreement, TfL, Southwark and developers, however TfL has no spending set aside.</p>

<p>The Director of Borough Partnerships explained that that the present tube does just about cope, however extra development will tip it over the edge and there will be regular closures. A member asked who is responsible and the Director of Borough Partnerships explained that the law says that if a developer causes the burden then the responsibility lies with them.</p>

<p>the vision of a thriving commercial centre for South 6
Regeneration and Leisure Scrutiny Sub-Committee - Wednesday 8 February 2012
London that minimised its environmental impact should be a hub for cycling
journeys for Southwark, Lambeth and beyond.   Cyclists in South London from
Greenwich to Tooting had been affected by having to traverse this junction and the
Elephant and Castle was a mental and physical barrier which deterred cyclists.<br/>
There were many cyclists who used the Elephant and Castle each day and many
stopped to use the facilities there.  The group wanted to see a safe and pleasant
orbital bypass, traffic free with links to segregated cycle lanes and quiet
connections to residential streets.  The group felt that it was possible to make the
Elephant and Castle into a world class cycling network.</p>

<p>Further discussion is required regarding the existing off-carriageway cycle lane
on New Kent Road.</p>

<p>As part of the proposed Cycle Superhighway 6 (Penge to the City), TfL has an
aspiration to provide an eastern bypass of the northern roundabout, linking
Walworth Road to New Kent Road. In order to be successful the route needs to
be as direct and convenient as possible.</p>

<p>Transport Statement Part 1 of 8 - 6.8.2 Cycling: A route for the new cycle superhighway (CS6) is not intended to be provided through the proposed Development. At the heart of the Proposed development is the provision of a new Park, a place for people to visit and enjoy as a leisure activity. The Proposed development is therefore designed to support leisure cyclists rather than being used as a cycling commuter route through the development which may discourage less confident cyclists and conflict with pedestrian movement.</p>

<p>Members were largely in favour of the Southwark Cyclists proposal.  They also
expressed concerns about TfL’s aspirations for plans to create bus only streets.<br/>
This plan was not in accord with the views or wishes of local residents and
commuters.  Members wanted to see the Elephant and Castle plans containing
more cycle and pedestrian provision and more consultation with local residents on
how they would envision the re-development.    <br/>
5.29 The group said that creating a northern peninsular road to stop traffic dominating
the area and by placing a cycle bypass linking the Walworth Road and New Kent
road would be the solution to curb the current high traffic in the area, which
increased the related risks to cyclists and pedestrians.<br/>
5.30 Members also felt that the current lift arrangements at the Elephant and Castle
tube station had been found inadequate and that more TfL money should be used
to install escalators which were more reliable and had greater capacity to transport
people to and from the platforms.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/images/elephantpark.JPG">The Heygate estate used to have a sizeable public park (Elephant Park), which was closed in 2011 <a href="http://elephantamenity.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/no-more-football-on-the-elephant-park/">- despite fierce opposition from local residents</a>. Half of the park was subsequently leased by the Council to the neighbouring <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7208">Delancey development</a> for use as a site compound for its construction works. The other half was licensed to Lend Lease for use as a temporary <a href="http://www.theartworks-uk.com/">&lsquo;Box Park&rsquo;</a> and <a href="http://li.zoocdn.com/f580110e0cb4bd7cce1cae252da4301159cb34e4_645_430.jpg">sales showroom</a>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="/images/HeygateCommunityAssetAudit.pdf">this 2002 audit by planning consultant Michael Parkes,</a> the Heygate estate used to comprise a total 24,195 square metres of public amenity open space.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/parkdimensions.png" width="300" height="200">Much fanfare has been made of Lend Lease&rsquo;s plan to create <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/672/final_masterplan_for_heygate_estate_revamp_revealed">central London&rsquo;s largest park in more than 70 years&#8217;</a>. However, according to Lend Lease&rsquo;s <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeResultDetail&amp;TheSystemkey=9544643">planning application</a>, the new park will be just 8,220 square metres in size - representing a net loss of more than two thirds of the site&rsquo;s open amenity space. When probed during the Feb 2013 CPO public inquiry into the scheme, architect <a href="/images/KenShuttleworthCPOevidenceFeb2013.pdf">Ken Shuttleworth said</a> the 70 years reference related to the nearby Geraldine Harmsworth Park (Imperial War Museum) as being the larger park opened in 1934. We did a little research and found that the claim to being central London&rsquo;s largest new park in 70 years is pure fiction and plainly ridiculous. Infact, it&rsquo;s not even the largest new park in Southwark in 70 years - let alone central London: the following Southwark parks are all larger than the one proposed by Lend Lease (0.82H) and have all received park designation since the Geraldine Harmsworth park was opened in 1934:</p>

<pre><code>*Potter's Field  1.35H
*Mint Street Park  .92H
*Leathermarket Gardens 1.15H 
*Tabard Gardens  1.75H
*Dickens Fields  1.20H  
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/224246_1.pdf"><img class="right" src="/images/parkcrosssection.png" width="400" height="300"></a>The <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/254738_1.pdf">planning application</a> also shows that the Heygate development&rsquo;s new park will be just 42m wide (around the same width as New Kent rd), overshadowed by 12-30 storey buildings and hemmed in by a new road servicing the development&rsquo;s <a href="/transport-hub">616 new car-parking spaces</a>:<br/>
</br>
</br>
This is a real kick in the teeth for local residents who can remember the promises of the original regeneration plans. These proposed a sizeable public park and public open space on the site of the Heygate as can be seen from the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/198503633/EandC-RegenMk1SLRplans">original masterplan</a> illustrations:</p>

<p><img src="http://heygate.github.io/img/elephantparkcomparison.png"></p>

<p> However, what is more disconcerting is that the planning application&rsquo;s <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/224077_1.pdf">&lsquo;Estate Management Strategy&rsquo; statement</a> states that the new park - and indeed the entire footprint of the development - is going to be privately owned and privately managed:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The long term regeneration vision is founded on the core principles of place making and central to this is the effective management of the spaces around Plots in addition to effective Plot and building management.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;It is likely that an umbrella Estate Management Company (EMC) will be created, with separate Plot Management Companies responsible for managing each Plot sitting under it. Each Plot will have its own Plot Management Company (PMC). Each PMC will be controlled by the leasehold owners of the new homes, the Registered Provider and the leasehold owners of the retail spaces within the Plot.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The Estate Management Company (EMC) will hold the land on a long leasehold basis from Lend Lease. The Estate Management Company shall be controlled by a main board of directors responsible for managing the company.&rdquo;</em>  
<img class="left" src="/images/emc.png"></p>

<p>The Estate Management Strategy appears to have quite clear ideas of how the behaviour of its residents will be monitored and controlled:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;<strong>7.5 Anti‐Social Behaviour Policy</strong> - The principles set out in the Anti‐Social Behaviour Policy will lay out common standards for the delivery of effective anti‐social behaviour services across the Estate, the Plots and as part of tenancy and leasehold management.&rdquo;</em> </br></p>

<p>The behaviour of non-residents will be monitored by a &lsquo;Town Centre Security Team&rsquo; and as the private owner of the land it will be legally entitled to expel any members of the public indulging in subversive activities like photography or picnicing:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;<strong>8.2 Security</strong> - The EMC and PMCs will have a key role in linking with local agencies, in particular the police, Southwark’s Anti‐Social Behaviour (ASB) services and the town centre security team and the local Community Safety teams.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Further reference to the planned privatisation of the space can be found in the <a href="http://southwark.gov.uk/download/elephant_and_castle_regeneration_agreement_appendix6.pdf">draft illustrative masterplan</a>: <em>&ldquo;To ensure that the high quality external environment is maintained the completed RA site will be managed by its own security, maintanence and cleaning service.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Furthermore, the &lsquo;Play Strategy&rsquo; <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/224082_1.pdf">(in the Landscape Strategy, pg 93)</a> proposes off-site provision of recreational space for older children (i.e over 12) on the basis that on site provision <em>&ldquo;is not considered practical or desirable, in respect to the intended character, use or scale of the space&rdquo;</em>. The picture that emerges is one of a tightly controled privatised space, from which local young people will be actively excluded. This is a contravention of the Equalities Act 2010, which bans discrimination on the basis of age.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://betterelephant.org/images/gatedcommunity.png" width="350" height="493">We have been campaigning to have arrangements here formalised by the Council, in order to avoid the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/11/public-spaces-undemocratic-land-ownership">‘privatised public space’ model</a> – places like More London or New Street Square.</p>

<p>Lend Lease owns the Bluewater retail and leisure centre in Kent, where it has banned shoppers who swear or wear hooded tops or baseball caps. It has also outlawed smoking, leafleting and canvassing on the 240-acre Bluewater site. We don&rsquo;t want Lend Lease to use Bluewater as a blueprint for its Heygate redevelopment. The Mayor of London&rsquo;s 2009 Manifesto for Public Space expresses concern at the <em>&ldquo;growing trend towards the private management of publicly accessible space, where this type of ‘corporatisation occurs, especially in the larger commercial developments, Londoners can feel themselves excluded from parts of their own city.&rdquo;</em> This need not be the case: at the Kings Cross redevelopment it was agreed that the London Borough of Camden will adopt the streets and public areas; unfortunately Southwark has rejected all calls for it to do the same.

<p>The redevelopment of the Heygate estate is essentially a land sale to a private developer. The Council <a href="/images/SNarticle.png">get a capital receipt</a> for the land and the developer provides some infrastructure and community benefits. There is an assumed <a href="/images/spdprofit.png">profit to the developer of 20%</a> of the total costs plus the profit left over when all the new buildings have been sold. The community benefits that were originally supposed to be provided in return for the Heygate redevelopment <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/82420796/Southwark-Council-2004-Development-Framework">were to include</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>A new school</li>
<li>A new library</li>
<li>A leisure centre</li>
<li>Affordable housing</li>
<li>A MUSCo energy utility</li>
<li>Upgrades to local public transport</li>
</ol>


<p>Plans for the school and library have now been dropped, and the leisure centre is being developed in a <a href="http://londonist.com/2012/03/further-elephant-and-castle-plans-revealed.php">separate land-sale development</a>.</p>

<p>The Heygate site was also supposed to provide <a href="http://localhost:4000/images/southwark_50percentcopy.png">50% affordable housing</a> and a <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5052">MUSCo</a> - (a biomass energy generation plant), which was going to provide &lsquo;green&rsquo; heat and power for the whole E&amp;C and Walworth area including the proposed development at the Aylesbury estate. This was in line with the &lsquo;zero carbon&rsquo; objectives for the scheme, which proposed that the new developments would all be carbon neutral and enabled it to be <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6032">selected as one of Bill Clinton&rsquo;s Climate Positive Initiatives</a>.</p>

<p>Now these too have been dropped from the scheme: the outline planning application contains no minimum guarantee of any affordable housing, and the biomass Combined Heat &amp; Power network has been <a href="/blog/2012/06/26/environmental-impact-understatement/">dropped in favour of a standard gas-fired boiler</a>, which will only supply the new homes on the Heygate footprint.</p>

<p>Lend Lease acknowledges that these changes are a significant deviation from the original plan and also a breach of planning policy, but justifies this in its planning application by claiming that these are constraints imposed by the financial viability of the scheme:</p>

<p><strong>Sustainability</strong>
<em>“A number of other alternative renewable energy sources are considered in the strategy. However, they do not secure the quantum of CO2 savings that are anticipated through biomethane and impact on the commercial viability.&ldquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>Affordable Housing</strong>
<em>“The outline planning application commits to the Site delivering as much affordable housing as is financially viable.&ldquo;</em></p>

It would therefore appear that financial viability is the key variable in the whole scheme and the main determinant of whether it will provide any community infrastructure at all.</p>

<p>Members of the local community have raised concerns about the proposed loss of community benefits from the scheme, and have <a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/viability_assessment_for_plannin#outgoing-205692">asked the Council to share information</a> about the scheme&rsquo;s viability. However, the Council has refused to make public any details concerning viability claiming that it is <em>&ldquo;likely to prejudice the commercial and economic interests of both the council and Lend Lease.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>All that has been released concerning viability so far is a <a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/financial_viability_of_proposed#incoming-288071">series of heavily redacted minutes</a> from Council meetings with Lend Lease and its planning consultants &lsquo;DP9&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The Government&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homes_and_Communities_Agency">Homes &amp; Communities Agency</a> has acknowledged these viability issues and has recently <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/sites/default/files/investment_and_planning_good_practice_note.pdf">published guidelines for local authorities</a> in responding to the economic downturn:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The HCA strongly encourages stakeholders to employ a transparent approach to considering viability. Transparent viability appraisals have the potential to remove the mistrust and suspicion that has often characterised negotiations around the viability of planning obligations sought by adopted planning policy.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The 35percent campaign urges Southwark to release information relating to viability testing, so that we can better understand why the scheme&rsquo;s original community benefits can no longer be provided.</p>

<p>We think this is especially important since <a href="/images/SNLLFraud12July2012.png">Lend Lease&rsquo;s recent conviction for serious fraud</a> in connection with a similar regeneration scheme in New York.</p>

<p>If you are a Southwark resident and wish to add your voice to this demand, you can do so by lodging an objection by following the instructions on the <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/485/planning_applications/686/comment_on_planning_applications/3">link here.</a> The planning application reference number is 12/AP/1092.</p>
