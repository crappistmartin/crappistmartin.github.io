  <div class="entry-content"><h2>£18m public money spent but no social rented housing</h2>


<p><img class="right" src="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/elephant_and_castle_360tower_web.jpg" width="300" height="200"><br/>
Boris Johnson has just announced that the UK&rsquo;s largest private rental development will be right at the heart of the Elephant &amp; Castle. The <em>360 Tower</em> on the old London Park Hotel site will provide 462 new homes, most of which will be for free-market rent. 188 will be &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; but mostly shared ownership, and a meagre 29 units - initially social rented - have since been <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/MD1240%20Newington%20MD%20Part%201%20PDF.pdf">turned into so-called &lsquo;affordable rent&rsquo;</a>. Needless to say that this is way below the 80 social rented units required by planning policy, and way beyond the means of most people living in Southwark<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. Today&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/tenancies/major-flaws-revealed-in-pay-to-stay-policy/6528085.article"><em>Inside Housing</em> article</a> reveals that the minimum salary needed for an &lsquo;affordable rent&rsquo; flat in Southwark is £46,790 pa.</p>

<p>Of the 188 &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; units 159 will be shared ownership. We have no information about how much they will cost, but Southwark Council&rsquo;s income threshold for shared ownership is currently around £30,000 per year for a 1-bed flat.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.the-latest.com/sites/default/files/images/12_1.jpg" width="300" height="200"><br/>
<strong>The past&hellip;</strong><br/>
The site was formerly home to the London Park Hotel, which provided low-cost accommodation including accommodation for asylum seekers. It was <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3475">bought by</a> Government agency &lsquo;English Partnerships&rsquo; for £18m in order to provide affordable housing for key workers. The current development was given planning permission by Southwark Council in 2007. The developers were then First Base, <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/2835">part of the Lend Lease consortium</a> selected as the council&rsquo;s E&amp;C development partner. The site then passed hands from English Partnerships to the Homes and Communities Agency and finally to the GLA. Along the way First Base dropped out, the overall amount of affordable housing was reduced and then the commitment to provide key-worker housing was dropped in January 2010. <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3475">In 2008</a>, chair of Southwark&rsquo;s planning committee James Gurling noted the <em>&ldquo;&lsquo;dreadful irony&rsquo; that the Government had spent millions of pounds acquiring the site – part of it from Southwark Council – for housing for people who can&rsquo;t afford it and now the committee was being asked to back a reduction in the number of such homes. A lot of money has gone round in a big circle and the net losers will be the people who need the help most.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>&hellip; and the future</strong><br/>
<img class="right" src="http://www.housingexcellence.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/large_490x270/public/Archway.jpg?itok=OXcNjsbc" width="300" height="200"><br/>
The <em>360 Tower</em> is now being funded by <a href="http://www.m3cp.com/">M3 Capital Partners</a> - a global real-estate investment company originally part of the Australian <a href="http://www.macquarie.com/">Macquarie group</a>. The tower will be managed by its subsidiary company <a href="http://www.essentialliving.uk.com/"><em>Essential Living</em></a> whose <a href="http://www.essentialliving.uk.com/">aim it is</a> to <em>&ldquo;revolutionise the private rental market&rdquo;</em>. <em>Essential Living</em> has recently become very active in Britain and has <a href="http://shbm-news.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/essential-livings-bethnal-green-scheme.html">5,000 new homes in its planning pipeline</a>. One of its projects is the controversial Archway Tower, and <em>Essential Living</em> <a href="http://www.housingexcellence.co.uk/news/london%E2%80%99s-archway-tower-become-rental-homes-gentrification-plan">makes no bones</a> about what its aim is: <em>&ldquo;Archway deserves regeneration and we believe our investment will be the catalyst to further gentrification in this important North London community.”</em></p>

<p> In a <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmcomloc/writev/953/prs125.htm">recent submission</a> to a parliamentary inquiry <em>Essential Living</em> asked for:</p>

<ul>
<li>The continued sale of public land to the private sector</li>
<li>Limits to lifetime and fixed-term tenancies for affordable housing</li>
<li>A relaxation of s106 contributions</li>
</ul>


<p><em>Essential Living</em> offers itself as an alternative to buy-to-let landlords who they <a href="http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/rogers-stirk-harbour-tower-to-be-a-uk-first/5058596.article">describe as amateurs</a>, but it admits that the costs of building, maintaining and managing their homes in the new American style setup will be more expensive, and is asking for changes in the way the viability of its developments is assessed within the planning process. Large developments must provide public benefits through <a href="/blog/2013/07/30/how-to-avoid-providing-affordable-housing-a-guide-for-developers/">s106 contributions</a>; these will be reduced if <em>Essential Living</em> gets its way.</p>

<p>Mayor Johnson thinks that M3 capital partners are the perfect new landlords. He hopes they will start a trend: <a href="http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/rogers-stirk-harbour-tower-to-be-a-uk-first/5058596.article">he said:</a> <em>“This ‘holy grail’ of investment in the riskier pre-development stage is a hugely important milestone but it is just the beginning. I want to entice other institutional investors to come forward and invest in quality homes for Londoners.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Essential Living?</strong><br/>
<em>Essential Living</em> do not appear to have any completed developments where we can see what their rent levels are, but if the so-called &lsquo;affordable rents&rsquo; are going to require an income of £46,790 per year, then we can confidently predict that the free-market rents won&rsquo;t come cheap.</p>

<p>Private rental and &lsquo;affordable rent&rsquo; don&rsquo;t feature anywhere in the policies or plans for the regeneration of Elephant &amp; Castle, but the <em>360 Tower</em> and <a href="/blog/2013/08/03/the-whole-world-comes-to-the-elephant/"><em>One the Elephant</em></a> show us that both will play a significant role, and that much of the regeneration&rsquo;s housing will be neither affordable nor owner-occupied. The Elephant &amp; Castle regeneration - Europe&rsquo;s largest regeneration scheme - is quickly becoming a property-investment bonanza, one moreover that is being funded through the disposal of public land.

<div id="appeal">
<h2>Stop the Press!</h2>
It was confirmed on Friday by the Information Tribunal that Southwark Council have appealed against the <a href="/blog/2013/07/24/heygate-figures-must-b-be-revealed-information-commissioner/">Information Commissioner&#8217;s decision</a> to order Southwark to disclose the Heygate masterplan viability assessment, submitted by developer Lend Lease in its planning application. Southwark have requested a hearing at which they will argue that while they <a href="http://youtu.be/sbSCIuaLFQ4">believe in openness and transparency</a>, on this occasion it would be best if the public was kept in the dark.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The start of work on <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6463"><em>One the Elephant</em></a> was marked with some ceremony this week by developers Lend Lease, including a visit by the mayor of London Boris Johnson. However it was a bit unfortunate for both him and Southwark Council that the symbolically important development has no affordable housing.</p>

<p>The event was covered by ITV and the BBC:</p>

<iframe width="350" height="197" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/c0tgOPOI1IE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>




<iframe width="350" height="197" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/WZRV4KMxuEk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>




<iframe width="350" height="197" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/uRSorzbUH94" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>The TV reports emphasised the lack of affordable housing. Mayor Johnson and Councillor Colley responded with the well-rehearsed defence that <em>One the Elephant</em> was providing a leisure centre instead, and that 1600 &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; housing units will be provided elsewhere in the regeneration.</p>

<h2>Affordable Housing?</h2>


<p>However, as was revealed at the recent CPO inquiry<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, less than half of these 1600 so-called &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; homes will be social rented - a net loss of around 500 after the loss of the Heygate estate. The affordable housing also includes part-buy/part-rent and over 200 units at the new iniquitous &lsquo;affordable rent&rsquo; at 50% market rent. Neither of these are options that are really affordable for the vast majority of people who need housing in Southwark. As this blog has repeatedly emphasised - social rent is the kind of affordable housing that Southwark needs most, yet it is precisely the kind that the Elephant regeneration is destroying.</p>

<p>In the ITV interview, Councillor Colley also referred to Southwark Council&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1301/council_bucks_national_trend_and_promises_vast_increase_in_number_of_council_houses">recent pledge</a> to build 10,000 council houses over the next 30 years. This pledge is very welcome and we hope to see it fulfilled, but affordable housing was to be one of the key benefits of the Elephant &amp; Castle regeneration, and these are homes that should be being built now.</p>

<h2>Profit in Leisure</h2>


<p><img class="left" src="http://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk/public/assets/news_articles/2013/05/1367907090_elephant--castle-leisure-centre---cgi.jpg" width="300" height="200">The leisure centre in lieu of affordable housing will cost around £20m<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>. Lend Lease&rsquo;s contribution to this is £3.5m<a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>. Has the sale of the land to Lend Lease generated the £17m shortfall? In any event Lend Lease got a good deal - the required 35% affordable housing contribution would have been around 100 units, and at £300k each<a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a> this would have cost Lend Lease £30m.</p>

<h2>Overseas and Off-Plan</h2>


<p><a href="/images/TrafalgarPlaceCN.png"><img class="right" src="/images/TrafalgarPlaceCN.png" width="400" height="300"></a> The BBC report also focused on the amount of free-market housing that Lend Lease is selling off-plan overseas for buy-to-let investment. Neither Boris Johnson nor Fiona Colley could say how much this would be, but if <em>One the Elephant</em> follows the <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/605cdea2-fb69-11e2-a641-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2auDlY5Ft">trend of 75% going overseas</a> then there will only be 70 units for British-based buyers who are wealthy enough to afford them.</p>

<p>Another recent <a href="http://youtu.be/7yuT3RlR1Zc">BBC report</a> also addresses the overseas buyer issue and local MP Simon Hughes initiated an <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/house-of-lords-22992949">adjournment debate</a> in the House of Commons where he gave his own ideas about how to solve the problem.</p>

<h2>Those who have had to leave us</h2>


<p><a href="/images/EveningStandardHeygateResidentsForcedOut.pdf"><img class="left" src="/images/EveningStandardHeygateResidentsForcedOut.png" width="200" height="390"></a>In an <a href="/images/EveningStandardHeygateResidentsForcedOut.pdf">Evening Standard article</a> respected journalist Mira Bar-Hillel focuses on those who have had to leave the Elephant to make way for the regeneration.</p>

<p>We covered this briefly in our <a href="/blog/2013/06/08/the-heygate-diaspora/">recent blog post</a>. The Standard article puts some faces to the statistics and shows what the regeneration has really been about for these former local people.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since our <a href="/blog/2013/07/24/heygate-figures-must-b-be-revealed-information-commissioner/">last blog post</a> we have been asked to explain more about viability assessments - also known as viability reports. These are a developer&rsquo;s analysis of the finances of their own scheme, and if this self-assessment demonstrates to the council&rsquo;s satisfaction that the scheme is not financially viable, then the developer is able do duck out of providing affordable housing.</p>

<p>As can be imagined, nearly all developers opt to submit a ‘financial viability assessment’.</p>

<p>In planning terms affordable housing is known as a section 106 obligation, and producing viability reports for developers is big business. These companies all provide the service:</p>

<p><a href="http://residential.joneslanglasalle.co.uk/residential-services/consultancy-services/affordable-housing.aspx">Jones Lang Lasalle</a>  -   <a href="http://www.hamptons.co.uk/land-and-new-homes/developer-services/viability,-affordability,-housing-section-106-(1)/">Hamptons</a>  -   <a href="http://www.wilkinsongrant.co.uk/land-a-development/confidential-property-register">Wilkinson Grant</a>  -
<a href="http://www.savills.co.uk/services/planning-and-development/planning/planning-policy/development-viability.aspx">Savills</a></p>

<p>For between £1,000 - £3,000 <a href="http://www.s106management.co.uk/">&lsquo;S106 Management Ltd&rsquo;</a> will produce a viability report that reduces or eliminates your affordable housing obligation. You can then take a holiday with the money that you have saved or pile it into your wheelbarrow as their website illustrates:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.s106management.co.uk/"><img src="/images/s106management2.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Viability reports are confidential, they are not made public and even members of the planning committee do not see them. They have to rely on the recommendation of planning officers (who in turn rely upon an assessment by the District Valuer’s Service).</p>

<p>So the <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/HeygateFOICommissionersReport.pdf">Information Commissioner&rsquo;s decision</a> to order the release of Lend Lease&rsquo;s viability report for the Heygate masterplan is a significant one. He particularly emphasises the importance of transparency in planning matters, and the need to maintain public confidence in the authority&rsquo;s decisions.</p>

<p>Southwark is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbSCIuaLFQ4&amp;feature=share&amp;list=UU1yTdlADczSqDS-DsEliI8A">committed to transparency</a>, it must now accept the Commissioner&rsquo;s decision and release the report.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="http://evacpack.co.uk/ICO.jpg" width="300" height="200">Southwark Council have been ordered to disclose the financial viability assessment provided by developer Lend Lease to secure the approval of its Heygate masterplan application. This assessment justified the reduction in the affordable housing requirement from 35% to 25% and the reduction of social rented housing to just 71 units.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/viability_assessment_for_plannin#incoming-304798">Freedom of Information request</a> for the viability assessment was rejected by Southwark Council, but the council&rsquo;s decision has now been overturned by the Information Commissioner who has given Southwark 35 days to produce the assessment.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/HeygateFOICommissionersReport.pdf">Commissioner&rsquo;s report</a> is a closely argued and detailed 35-page document. It draws upon previous decisions made both by the Commissioner and the Information Tribunal to come to its conclusions.</p>

<p>The Commissioner&rsquo;s judgement was that there was a <strong>&ldquo;very significant weighting in favour of disclosing the information&rdquo;</strong><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, and that <strong>&ldquo;The public interest in disclosing the information outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exception.&rdquo;</strong><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> i.e. keeping the information confidential. The Commissioner acknowledged that disclosing the information was detrimental to Lend Lease&rsquo;s commercial interests, but did not think that Southwark Council&rsquo;s own commercial interests were relevant. He also acknowledged that Lend Lease were entitled to confidentiality, but thought that the greater public interest was served by the disclosure. Additional factors that gave increased weight to his argument included <strong>&ldquo;any perception that an authority might not be acting in accordance with its own policies&rdquo;</strong>.<a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a> In addition he cited<a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The scale of the scheme (£1.5bn over 15 years)</li>
<li>The number of Heygate residents affected by the scheme (3,000) and subject to rehousing and Compulsory Purchase Orders.</li>
<li>The loss of council-owned property through sale of public land to a private enterprise.</li>
<li>The costs incurred to date by the council in taking the scheme forward (£47.9m)</li>
<li>Public concern about the level of affordable housing provided by the scheme and how this sits with the council&rsquo;s Core Strategy.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY</strong><br/>
The Commissioner refers several times to the high level of public interest in the development:</p>

<blockquote><p>In relation to the general public interest in transparency and accountability, the Commissioner’s general view is that, where this relates to planning matters, there is a strong weighting in favour of encouraging public participation and disclosure is a means of promoting this.</p><footer><strong>Information Commissioner&#8217;s Report</strong> <cite>Paragraph 167</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>He notes the press and television attention that the development has received, and considers that the focus of public debate and concern has been on the levels of affordable housing provision delivered by the scheme. Disclosure of the viabilty assessment would inform this debate and reassure the public that the council&rsquo;s decision to allow Lend Lease’s proposals to proceed were based on a correct analysis of the facts presented.</p>

<p><strong>BEST CONSIDERATION?</strong><br/>
<a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/HeygateFOICommissionersReport.pdf"><img class="left" src="/images/HeygateFOICommissionersReport.png" width="200" height="400"></a>The Commissioner also considered that the disposal of the land and its sale price were matters of <strong>&ldquo;relevant public interest&rdquo;</strong>. He acknowledged the difficulties of obtaining best value in the current economic climate, and the argument that the council should be allowed to simply press on with the regeneration. However, he comes down on the side of what he calls a <strong>&ldquo;compelling countervailing argument in favour of making this process as transparent as possible&rdquo;</strong>. He considers the <strong>&ldquo;size of the redevelopment and the number of residents affected should provide a trigger for transparency and engagement with council tax payers&rdquo;</strong><a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>, and that the council should expect a <strong>&ldquo;high level of scrutiny&rdquo;</strong>.<a href="#footnote-6">[6]</a></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Commissioner notes that the scheme will not deliver the level of affordable housing required by the council’s own core strategy. In this respect alone, there is a significant public interest in demonstrating to the public that the council’s decision to progress with the scheme is nevertheless justified.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Information Commissioner&#8217;s Report</strong> <cite>Paragraph 100</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p><strong>A LANDMARK DECISION?</strong><br/>
Southwark can demonstrate its commitment to transparency and accountability by accepting the Commissioner&rsquo;s decision without further ado. There will be more viability assessments submitted in the future - local councillors, planning committee members, and members of the general public must be able to see them, particularly if council policy is not being fulfilled. It is ridiculous that the masterplan planning application was passed blind by the planning committee - it dents Southwark Council and Lend Lease&rsquo;s credibility, and local people&rsquo;s confidence in the regeneration process.</p>

<p>The South London Press <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/SouthLondonPress23July2013.pdf">reports</a> that Southwark maintains that the assessment should not be made public and that it is <strong>&ldquo;seeking further advice to determine its best course of action&rdquo;</strong>. Every one of our elected councillors - regardless of which party they are in - should say different and insist that the viability assessment is released without further delay.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;With the increasing outsourcing of public services and disposal of public assets to private partners or third parties, the Commissioner considers that there is a growing need for transparency and accountability in authorities’ decision-making and expenditure, not least because many parties which authorities conduct business with will not themselves be subject to the EIR or FOIA.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Information Commissioner&#8217;s Report</strong> <cite>Paragraph 171</cite></footer></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Compulsory Purchase of the remaining 3 leaseholders on the Heygate estate has been approved by Eric Pickles, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. This will allow Southwark Council to buy out the properties at way below the local market rate.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are being short-changed and priced out of the area.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I am being offered just £150,000 for my two-bed flat, when the new-build two-bed Heygate flats are currently being marketed overseas for upwards of £455,000.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Heygate Leaseholder</strong> <cite>Mojisola Ojeikere</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p><img class="right" src="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/418865_406280396101674_377969546_n.jpg" width="300" height="200">It is not surprising that Mr Pickles approved Southwark&rsquo;s application. The decision is taken on the basis that the estate is now empty and takes little account that it was once the home to 3,000 people. Mr Pickles decided that it was in the public interest for the development to proceed rather than to allow the leaseholders to keep their homes. The leaseholders&#8217; responses can be seen in this <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-23371735">BBC report</a>.</p>

<p>The decision was the result of a 4 day public inquiry in February this year. Some points in Inspector Wenda Fabian&rsquo;s <a href="/images/Heygate_CPO_Inspectors_Report.pdf">conclusions</a> are worth noting:</p>

<p>She says <em>&ldquo;The quantity of the social rented accommodation on the site of the former estate would be dramatically reduced, some 71 units compared to the 750 formerly existing.&rdquo;</em> The Inspector goes on to note that the &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; rented homes would be provided at higher levels of rent than were current on the estate.</p>

<p>She also says that the evidence given by various academics (Prof. Loretta Lees - King&rsquo;s College, Michael Edwards - UCL, Mara Ferreri - Queen Mary University) were a <em>&ldquo;matter of wider social policy consideration&rdquo;</em>, rather than a particular consideration for the inquiry. This evidence showed that regeneration schemes displace those people whose deprivation was the justification for the regeneration, and that low-income residents do not benefit from mixed communities - they lose the economic and social advantages of living in a low-income communitiy.</p>

<p>The Inspector addressed the vexed question of the scheme&rsquo;s financial viability. She noted that <em>&ldquo;although commercially sensitive viability figures were not produced for the Inquiry&rdquo;</em>, she did not doubt that Lend Lease would fulfil its commitments because <em>&ldquo;the reputational consequence for Lend Lease of a market failure on this site so close to the City of London would be substantial&rdquo;.</em></p>

<p>In relation to viability, the Inspector allowed the need for 616 new car parking spaces despite the requirements set out in policy that there should be none.</p>

<p>The Inspector had little doubt that the shopping centre situation can be resolved. She says <em>&ldquo;its regeneration by the current owner is still feasible and Lend Lease is cooperating in the redevelopment project discussions on this basis.&rdquo;</em> Since it has been just <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6937">been reported</a> that the owners of the shopping centre are now considering its sale unless Southwark approves its development plans <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6808">(so far resisted)</a>, it remains to be seen whether this confidence is justified.</p>

<h2>What Next?</h2>


<p>The council will now write to the objectors and inform them of the decision. After two months, ownership of the homes will transfer to Southwark Council.</p>

<p>The council will then serve a further notice and occupants will have 28 days to vacate the property. If they do not do so, the council is entitled to take steps to gain possession.</p>

<p>Following vacant possession, leaseholders will then finally have the opportunity to refer the valuation of their homes to a Lands Tribunal if they still disagree with Southwark&rsquo;s offer of compensation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="http://www.artslondonnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DSCN7813.jpg" width="300" height="200">Six months after the appearance of 48 large shipping containers on the forecourt of the former Shell garage on the Walworth rd by the Heygate estate, a planning application for their uses has finally appeared. It has been submitted by &lsquo;Artworks&rsquo;, who were chosen to provide interim uses on the Heygate site during the period of its redevelopment. The model for the boxpark is a scheme in Shoreditch. The proposal is for studios, bars, business/workspace, retail, markets, cafe/restaurant, gallery, community, and &lsquo;stay-work&rsquo; uses for a maximum 5 year period.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://notesonallure.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_4547.jpg" width="500" height="350"></p>

<p>The application is generating a lot of interest while raising a lot of questions. Artworks say that it will generate job and education opportunities while helping to animate that part of the Walworth road. However, local people are concerned of what the impact will be on what is also a residential area. There are also doubts about the feasibility of the proposals: the application says that the rents will start at £50 per week, but we know from the marketing information reproduced below that the full cost of a &lsquo;live-work&rsquo; container is £200 per week plus bills.</p>

<p>Artworks are offering &lsquo;Short-term living accommodation for business operators&rsquo;<a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a> - but the containers are too small to meet Southwark&rsquo;s policy requirements<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> for live/work use; which is probably why Artworks have called them &lsquo;stay-work&rsquo; units in the application rather than &lsquo;live-work&rsquo; units in their marketing material. Any application for more than 10 units of residential accommodation would also trigger the requirement for 35% affordable housing.</p>

<p>The temporary nature of the development might relieve Artworks of the obligation to provide the usual s106 contributions, which mitigate the adverse consequences of developments by providing such things as local facilities and training. Artworks say that these benefits will come from the scheme anyway; Southwark planning has asked for more detail to demonstrate that this will be so, and that the scheme will actually provide the jobs it hopes to. It has also asked whether any of the units will provide any affordable retail/business space<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>The green space in front of Swanbourne will also be part of the boxpark. Artworks say that <em>&ldquo;The open space will be available for use by the public other than when it is being used for specific and occasional private events.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>All in all, this seems like a largely commercial development some way removed from the original idea of interim uses as providing space for productive voluntary activities. The application might have its merits, but it should be judged on these alone.</p>

<p>If you wish to make a comment on the application, you can send this by email to planning.applications@southwark.gov.uk, quoting the planning application reference: 13/AP/1224. <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeResultDetail&amp;TheSystemkey=9549395">Here is a link</a> to the full planning application documents.</p>

<h2>The Boxpark Vision</h2>


<p>Artworks may have just got their application in but they are not wasting any time advertising the containers. Below is a response to an email enquiry regarding the boxpark. The price for the container units is a lot clearer than it is in the planning application. £50 per week gets you a market stall, £150 - £170 per week gets you a work space, and full live-work container will set you back £200 per week plus bills. But hurry!</p>

<p><a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/examples/PROPWK170513.pdf">Property Week Magazine - 17/05/13</a></p>

<p>In our <a href="/blog/2013/05/26/peters-denial/">last blog post</a> we corrected some of the more <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/87Yg_SJoPjw">fanciful claims</a> that council leader Peter John made about the rehousing of Heygate tenants.
<a href="/blog/2013/05/26/peters-denial/">We showed</a> that only 45 Heygate tenants have actually been rehoused in new homes. We now also know that only around 1 in 5 Heygate secure tenants actually remain in the SE17 postcode (216 tenants out of 1034). This information comes from a response to an <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/analysis_of_displaced_heygate_re#incoming-394155">FOI request</a>. The rest have been scattered to the outer corners of the borough and beyond:</p>

</center>


<p>While we know what has happened to the secure tenants, Southwark can supply no information about where the 438 insecure tenants were rehoused. These are tenants who had moved onto the estate since Jan 2001, when Southwark stopped issuing proper council secure tenancies, and started using the estate for temporary accommodation. Such insecure tenants had no right at all to a new property out of the regeneration. Those who were eligible for council housing, will in most cases have been moved into existing council stock throughout the borough.</p>

<p>We are still gathering information about leaseholders. What we know so far is that they have moved furthest of all residents, as the following illustration shows:<br/>
</br><h3>
<a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?msid=206540700955382422085.0004ddeb74e646a7276ee&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=51.541211,0.223846&amp;spn=0.699521,1.234589">Heygate Leaseholder Displacement Map</a></h3>(using data submitted by Southwark Council at the Feb 2013 Heygate CPO Public Inquiry)<br/>
<a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?msid=206540700955382422085.0004ddeb74e646a7276ee&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=51.541211,0.223846&amp;spn=0.699521,1.234589"><img src="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/LeaseholderDisplacement1.png"></a></p>

<p>Around half have relocated to SE postcodes (including Woolwich, Thamesmead and Welling), most of the rest have had to move to suburbs such as Sidcup, St. Albans, Chelmsford, Croydon, Bexleyheath, Ilford, Romford, Dartford, Cheshunt, Mitcham and West Thurrock. The reason for this is clear: the very low levels of compensation leaseholders have received for their Heygate homes. <a href="/images/LBSHeygateacquisitionsOct2012.xls">This link</a> has a full list of the amounts paid to Heygate leaseholders. It is compiled from information received through Freedom of Information requests, and includes an indexed column showing today&rsquo;s value of the settlements.</p>

<p>The average compensation paid for a 1 bed flat is £108,164 (indexed to today&rsquo;s value). Owners of 2 bed flats received on average £122,140, 3 bed maisonettes £185,070 and 4 bed maisonettes £209,440. Some homeowners got particularly poor deals: one leaseholder received just £32,000 for a 1 bed flat in 2008.</p>

<p>Compare this to the cost of the new Heygate homes as advertised by Lend Lease.
These start at £330k for a 1 Bed flat, £455k for a 2 Bed flat and £590k for a 3 Bed - <a href="http://www.trafalgarplace.com">(www.trafalgarplace.com)</a></p>

<p>All in all not many residents - whether a secure tenant, an insecure tenant or a leaseholder - will get either a new home or a home at the Elephant through the regeneration.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There was no sound of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial_of_Peter">cock crowing</a>, but when asked in a recent radio interview if it is correct that there would only be 79 social rented units on the new Heygate, council leader Peter John replied &lsquo;no&rsquo; three times.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ENIkTjE0XB8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>However, while Councillor John does go on to say that the 3 bed affordable units for rent will be at council rent levels, he cannot bring himself to say that there will only be 79 of these, as we can see in the document pages below.</p>

<p><a href="/images/ahframework2.png"><img src="/images/ahframework2.png" width="310" height="450"></a><a href="/images/schedule6.png"><img src="/images/schedule6.png" width="310" height="450"></a></p>

<p>These are Appendix 4 and schedule 6 respectively of the two s106 agreements covering the Heygate site. They are legal agreements that detail how much public benefit the developers will provide, including affordable housing.</p>

<p>Like many such agreements they are not always clear to ordinary people, but look carefully at the highlighted areas and you can see the figures 71, 6 and 2 - making a total of 79 three-bed homes (i.e. council or social rent levels).</p>

<p>Councillor John also says that the 1&amp;2 bed affordable homes for rent will be at 50% market rents (there will be 212 of these). But at 50% of market rent, affordable rent is no substitute for social rent. <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/eip-ema-15_LB_Southwark_Matter2_Appendix%20A.pdf">&lsquo;Southwark Council&rsquo;s Response to the London Plan Revised Minor Early Alterations consultation in June 2012&rsquo;</a> shows this very clearly: in SE17 at 50% market rent the average weekly rent across all unit sizes is £194, while the median weekly income of a council house tenant is £174.</p>

<p>We can also see from the s106 agreements, that there will be a total of 291 affordable homes for rent, either affordable rent or social rent - much fewer than the 700 Cllr John says will be available during the interview. The difference is made up by 296 part buy-part rent units, which Cllr John doesn&rsquo;t mention at all.</p>

<p>The Heygate estate had 1200 social rented units, there will now be 79. Southwark has 20,000 households on its housing waiting list. They should be Southwark&rsquo;s priority but none will be housed in the new Heygate.</p>

<h2>Heygate Happiness</h2>


<p></p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/87Yg_SJoPjw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>In the same interview, Cllr John also paints a rosy picture of the rehousing of former Heygate residents. He says that the vast majority have moved into brand new homes and are delighted. In fact the vast majority have simply been moved into existing council house stock elsewhere in the borough, and only 45 have moved to brand new homes. This was conceded by Southwark Council at the recent <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/CPOPressRelease.pdf">public inquiry determininig a Compulsory Purchase Order</a> on the remaining leaseholders on the Heygate estate.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8221;__5.16__ &#8230;the Acquiring Authority agreed that tenants leaving from this point onwards were entitled to a right to return to new build affordable housing property built through the early sites programme or secured through a development within the core area [via a s106 agreement] for a period of up to seven years. Subsequently 250 tenants entered into such an agreement with the Acquiring Authority. To date 45 former Heygate Estate tenants have chosen to return to a new home made available through this process.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Statement of Evidence, CPO Public Inquiry 5th Feb 2013</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/8171/proofs_of_evidence__jon_abbot__final_proof'>www.southwark.gov.uk/download/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>




<h2>Returning to Nowhere</h2>


<p>Cllr John also mentions the <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/righttoreturn.pdf">&lsquo;right to return&rsquo;</a> in his interview. This supposedly enables former Heygate residents to return to the new properties on the Heygate estate.</p>

<p>This was only offered to the secure tenants on the estate (only around 600 by the time of the decant in 2007). It expires on 30 Sep 2015. Only 8 social rented units and only 54 affordable units of any kind will be built by then. Above all, there will only be 79 social rented units in the whole development - whenever it is finished.</p>

<p>Leaseholders won&rsquo;t fare any better: the levels of compensation offered for their homes does not allow them to buy in the area, let alone at the prices quoted for <a href="http://trafalgarplace.com/">Trafalgar Place</a> - the first phase of the new Heygate - which start at £310,000 for a one bedroom flat.</p>

<p>Worst off of all were the insecure tenants. Southwark stopped issuing secure tenancies in January 2001, and <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/HeygateActionPlan.pdf">by 2007</a> there were over 400 insecure tenants. By the <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Housing%20Scrutiny%20Committee/20080123/Agenda/December%2011update.pdf">time of the decant</a> there were still around 300 temporary tenants. These were not given the right to return option at all.</p>

<p>All in all, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what kind of resident you were, the chances of you getting back on the Heygate are very very small.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;There should have been new homes built for residents before they moved. That didn&#8217;t happen. But they&#8217;ve got the right to return. In reality, though, few will come back to the social housing on the new site.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Councillor Fiona Colley</strong> <cite>Cabinet Member for Regeneration</cite></footer></blockquote>

<h2>Heygate Was Home</h2>


<p>Finally, according to Cllr John the Heygate was also a <b><em>&lsquo;by-word for social failure, crime and antisocial behaviour&rsquo;</em></b>. Former residents beg to differ and have set up a website in an attempt to set the record straight: <a href="http://heygatewashome.com">www.heygatewashome.com</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/plazagone1.jpg" width="350" height="220"> An eagle-eyed member of the local community has noticed that the <a href="/images/TribecaHoardingsLicence.jpg">licence that allows the hoarding</a> surrounding the Tribeca Square site - formerly known as Oakmayne Plaza, <a href="/images/volvocpo.jpg">formerly known as the Volvo garage</a> - has expired. Perhaps the licence has since been renewed, but the hoarding stretching from the New Kent road down Elephant road to the Walworth road, has been a great nuisance and inconvenience to pedestrians since 2006.
After a spurt of on-site activity in 2009 progress has halted.</p>

<p>Oakmayne Director, Martin Lent has recently said that Oakmayne intends to return to Southwark planning to &lsquo;tweak&rsquo; their application before work re-commences. What this means remains to be seen: the <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3641">original application was comprehensively tweaked</a> so that no affordable housing would sully the development. In return, Oakmayne was going to build a huge basement, which was to house the MUSCo &lsquo;subterranean servicing complex&rsquo; between the Heygate and the shopping centre. Now that the <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5052">MUSCo has been ditched</a>, there will be plenty of room for some affordable housing in the development - even if it is in the basement.</p>

<h2>Viability Trumps All</h2>


<p>An <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/viability_assessment_for_plannin#outgoing-205692">FOI request refused by Southwark Council</a> over a year ago, has now been partially conceded. The request asked for the viability assessment for the Heygate masterplan application, and was referred to the Information Commissioner after Southwark&rsquo;s refusal. The Commissioner has now said that Southwark is willing to release some of the information requested. We don&rsquo;t know how much and how useful this information will be, but we are looking forward to seeing it.</p>

<p>Developers use viability assessments to relieve themselves of the obligation to provide affordable housing. They are supposed to be objective but in fact are highly contested, as this extract from the GLA report for the aforementioned Oakmayne development from 2007 shows:</p>

<p><img src="/images/gla.jpg"></p>

<p>Councillors on Southwark&rsquo;s planning committee - the people who actually take the decisions - are not allowed to see viability assessments, despite their critical importance. This is not the case in all boroughs: some like Haringey and Lewisham allow councillors to view them, albeit with certain conditions. Whatever information we will receive, we will be more than happy to share.</p>

<p><strong>Re-phasing the Heygate</strong><br/>
The Heygate estate development <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6817">is to be re-phased</a>. The next two phases were due to comprise 1940 homes on the main site north of Heygate street adjoining the Oakmayne site and shopping centre. The next phase is now to be of 360 homes on the south side of Heygate street site adjoining Wansey street. This is welcome to Wansey street residents, who will see that part of the development completed first rather than last within the 15 year scheduled development cycle. It might also make better commercial sense for Lend Lease to hold off from the main development, given the uncertainty surrounding the shopping centre and Oakmayne developments.</p>

<p>Consultation on the Wansey street phase <a href="http://www.elephantandcastle.org.uk/pages/news_events/215/elephant_castle.html">has now begun</a> and the planning application is expected to be submitted in September.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/heygatephases.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Shopping Centre</strong><br/>
Southwark&rsquo;s Liberal Democrat opposition has <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6808">called for the Compulsory Purchase of the shopping centre</a>. This is a possibility we raised in our previous blog post, but there is little doubt that the owners of the shopping centre, St. Modwen would contest such an action vigorously and have the firepower to do so effectively. There is also the impact on the retailers and shopkeepers in the centre to be considered. On the other hand, Southwark council needs to be able to exert some sort of pressure on St Modwen, or otherwise the whole regeneration will be held hostage by them. St Modwen also needs to overcome its reluctance to engage with the wider community about its plans for the centre.</p>

<p>We note Cllr Fiona Colley&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6808">comments on the SE1 website</a>, and are happy that she is pushing for a better deal. But this is a conversation we should all be part of: what is the offer on the table from St Modwen? And what is it that Southwark is demanding from them?</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;So far, in our discussions with St Modwen, we have not been presented with a plan for the shopping centre that we believe delivers the right solution for local people or the area especially concerning appropriate levels of affordable housing.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Fiona Colley</strong> <cite>Cabinet Member for Regeneration</cite></footer></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="http://www.urban75.org/photos/london/images/lon520.jpg" width="300" height="200">
Mystery abounds about what is happening with the Elephant &amp; Castle shopping centre. An article purporting to give the latest information on www.costar.co.uk was removed from their website after only a day. But the google cached version can still be <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:www.costar.co.uk/en/assets/news/2013/April/600m-Elephant--Castle-shopping-centre-plans-on-hold/">viewed here</a> If the article is accurate it looks like nothing will be done until 2014 at the earliest; shopping centre owner St. Modwen/Salhia promised a planning application by the end of this year. It seems that St. Modwen and Southwark cannot agree on the amount of housing the development should have: St. Modwen want 1,000 new homes but Southwark council want no more than 500. No details are given of how much affordable housing either option would provide.</p>

<p>It is worth remembering that the redevelopment of the shopping centre was considered the critical element for the success of the Elephant &amp; Castle regeneration. It was to provide the &lsquo;destination&rsquo; retail units that were to attract affluent shoppers to the area, and along with private housing would raise the general level of local prosperity. After Southwark signed the regeneration agreement with Lend Lease in July 2010, it did consider the &lsquo;nuclear&rsquo; option of compulsory purchase of the shopping centre, but in the event a deal was struck with St. Modwen, making them something like a third partner to the regeneration.</p>

<p>Southwark awaits the decision of its recent <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/CPOPressRelease.pdf">Compulsory Purchase Order</a> for of Heygate leaseholders. If it is granted, will Southwark&rsquo;s success embolden it to revisit this option for the shopping centre?</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/1311085254_80.177.117.97.jpg" width="300" height="200">Deputy Mayor for Transport Isabel Dedring, also appears to have a different idea for the shopping centre if the reference to its demolition is accurate. St. Modwen favour refurbishment and redevelopment of the existing structure. The uncertaintly surrounding the remodelling of the northern roundabout and the northern line upgrade are also big factors. A feasibility study of the roundabout&rsquo;s peninsularisation is due to appear this month. Agreement is still pending for the funding of the northern line tube station capacity upgrade.</p>
