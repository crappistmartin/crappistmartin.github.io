  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/eileen-housenew.jpg" width="320" height="320">The decision on the <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeDocs&amp;TheSystemkey=9531326">Eileen House planning application</a>, 335 flats, 41 stories  has been delayed once more.  The public hearing that was to be held 24 Oct at City Hall has been postponed for ‘procedural reasons’.  Previous hearings in March and February were also cancelled.
While Southwark’s housing waiting list accelerates upwards, developers Oakmayne and the Ministry of Sound have battled over the fate of this key development site.  The application was submitted in 2009 and rejected by Southwark in 2011.  The power of decision was then taken over by Boris Johnson, who has been reviewing it ever since.</p>

<p>One of Southwark’s grounds for rejecting the application was that it has no social rented housing, but this wasn’t an obstacle for the Elephant’s other ‘Towers of Shame’ – Strata Tower, One the Elephant, St Mary’s residential, Tribeca Square– which don’t have a single social rented unit amongst their 1500 homes.  The real obstacle has been determined objections from Ministry Of Sound, which fears future complaints from their new neighbours.
MoS’s concerns are no doubt well founded and young people have a legitimate need to dance themselves silly, but in a sensible world this would be trumped by the need of others for somewhere to live – not that this need will be properly met by another social housing-free development.</p>

<p>For its part Oakmayne  should be told – no social housing means no planning approval, but the chances of Mayor Johnson taking this view are non-existent.
MoS and Oakmayne pay lip-service to the aims of the regeneration but define it entirely in their own self-interested terms; local people (and Southwark Council) have been reduced to bystanders.</p>

<p><strong>N.B.:</strong>Oakmayne, like <a href="/images/StrataLRTitle.pdf">Strata Tower developers</a> are registered as an offshore company on the Isle of Man and therefore pay no UK tax. This setup also <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/16/london-property-tax-avoidance-offshore">enables it</a> to legally sell its flats while avoiding the payment of stamp duty.</p>

<h2>SHOPPING CENTRE LATEST</h2>


<p><img class="left" src="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/1255443526_80.177.117.97.jpg" width="300" height="200">Battle lines are also being drawn over the road at the Elephant shopping centre.  Southwark Council leader Peter John <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7151">told the council assembly</a> that he expected shopping centre owners St Modwen to deliver a development plan by the end of the year. He ruled out refurbishment as an acceptable option. Previously head of regeneration Cllr Fiona Colley <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7077">had also said</a> the shopping centre would be demolished. St Modwen’s say very little, though there have been press reports that they might sell up, with Lendlease rumoured as purchasers.
One thing continues unchanged – shopkeepers and their customers have been left out of this conversation.
The shopping centre is much ridiculed, but an awful lot of people work, shop and socialise there and it is time they were brought into the arguments about its future.</p>

<h2>BOX PARK MARK II</h2>


<p><img class="left" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ujXl9dbqKE8/UYfaKxGkomI/AAAAAAAABDE/FC250zOeDRU/s1600/IMG_3352.JPG" width="300" height="200">The consultation period for the second planning application for the <a href="/blog/2013/06/22/a-little-bit-of-shoreditch/">Box Park</a> has just ended, although comments will still be received by Southwark planning.  The park has grown in size to 56 units (each a shipping container) and been moved down the road from the Shell garage to the corner of Walworth Rd and Elephant Rd, formerly Elephant Park.
<img class="right" src="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/elephant-rd.jpg" width="300" height="200">Many remember that the London Latin American community used to have a <a href="http://www.thefirstpint.co.uk/2011/04/16/londons-heygate-estate-the-end-of-utopia/">football league here</a>, before the Park had to be <a href="https://elephantamenity.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/no-more-football-on-the-elephant-park/">given up</a> to the <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3641">Tribeca Square development</a>; developers Delancey say they can manage without it after all, so it now looks like a needless sacrifice.
This aside, nearby Wansey St residents welcome the move of the Box Park away from their immediate vicinity.<br/>
Other changes include the name (it is now known as The Artworks), dropping the live/work element of the proposal, which was met with scepticism from the many artists and artisans in the area, and the inclusion of a marketing suite for Lendlease, developers of the Heygate estate.  Otherwise the application proposes a similiar mix of  uses – retail, café, restaurant, indoor market, business workspace, gallery, community space – although the extent of each is not specified.
It will be a temporary development for five years and the applicants are asking that the usual s106 contributions (for mitigating the impact of developments) be waived in this instance, partly because of its temporary nature, partly because the s106 benefits are supposedly included in the application already.
Curiously, Artworks has not withdrawn the previous application for the Shell garage site, saying simply that it has <strong> <em>‘..yet to be determined by the Council’.</em> </strong>  The new application’s reference  number is 13/AP/2927; planning documents can be found <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeDocs&amp;TheSystemkey=9551217">here.</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="http://dailybail.com/storage/bill-clinton-404_683090c.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1285011722646" width="300" height="200">Last week, Elephant &amp; Castle developer Lend Lease was <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/business/markets/property-southwark-gets-a-new-lease-of-life-8841328.html">awarded participant status</a> in Bill Clinton&rsquo;s Global Climate Initiative. According to <a href="http://www.c40cities.org/c40blog/leading-the-way-forward-progress-in-australia">C40 Cities Group</a> - a group of cities world-wide combating the effects of climate change - <strong> <em>‘Climate Positive Development Partners have made a commitment to achieve net-negative, on-site, operational greenhouse gas emissions’</em> </strong>.</p>

<p>The Elephant’s regeneration <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8056859.stm">first attracted</a> the Clinton foundation’s attention while it still included plans for having a Multi Utilities Services Company (MUSCo) as part of the Heygate and shopping centre redevelopment. This would have produced 100% renewable energy on-site, with zero carbon emissions, and possibly more than was needed, making it ‘carbon positive’.</p>

<h4> MUSCo vs Emission Reductions</h4>


<p><img class="left" src="http://www.bdunlop.com/images/Elephant-and-Castle/energy_envrnmtl-services_lge.gif" width="300" height="200">The Global Climate Initiative participant status has been awarded to Lend Lease for reducing operational emissions, in other words reducing day-to-day C02 emissions from homes and businesses. The MUSCo would have done more than this: it would have provided its own renewable energy making the entire development self-sufficient. The <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5052">MUSCo was dropped</a> from the Regeneration Agreement Southwark signed with Lend Lease in 2010.
Instead of producing renewable energy on-site through the MUSCo Lend Lease are planning to buy in biomethane gas from off-site producers, rather like using a green electricity tariff.
A close reading of this <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeResultDetail&amp;TheSystemkey=9550213">Energy Strategy</a> tells us that while it might have won an award from Bill Clinton, it does not conform to Southwark Council’s planning policy requirements:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/page11.jpg"></p>

<p>Lend Lease assert that notwithstanding this failure, energy emissions will be over 50% less than they would have been without the its strategy of ‘energy hierarchy principles and…energy commitment’. It also lives in hope that Southwark will have a change of heart;</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/page112.jpg"></p>

<p>In short, Lend Lease’s energy strategy is simply to buy in biomethane gas and hope that Southwark brings its planning policy into line with its proposals.</p>

<p>Biomethane can be a good source of renewable energy but it does need plant to produce it, which is why Southwark&rsquo;s policy requires it to be on-site. The policy needs improving too: the renewables requirement currently stands at 20%, the MUSCo would have provided 100% - which is what is needed if we want truly sustainable cities.</p>

Regeneration Cabinet member Councillor Fiona Colley <a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/development/council-to-refuse-demands-about-heygate-estate/6528392.article">blames</a> a minority of people looking fruitlessly for something sinister.<br/>
Cllr Colley misses the point: the problem isn’t that there might be something sinister going on, the problem is that Southwark has lost about 600 social rented units because Elephant developers routinely use viability assessments to avoid building them.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/1358323753_46.233.70.67.jpg" width="300" height="200">Taken together the Strata Tower, 360 Tower, Tribeca Square, Heygate estate and &lsquo;One the Elephant&rsquo; will deliver about 4000 units, but only 79 social rented homes  - there should be nearly  ten times that amount, 700 or so if Southwark had stuck to its affordable housing policy.  All these developments used financial viability assessments.  An <a href="/blog/2013/07/30/how-to-avoid-providing-affordable-housing-a-guide-for-developers/">earlier blog post</a> shows that providing them is a small industry.  The trick is to get one which shows that there will be less than 20% profit, after all values, costs and sales revenue are accounted for. The development is then classed as unviable and the affordable housing can be dropped.</p>

<p>Developers hide their assessments behind &lsquo;commercial confidentiality&rsquo;.  This prevents planning committee members from seeing them.  The same councillors are expected to approve the planning applications nonetheless and more often than not do so.  In fact there is probably little developers don&rsquo;t know about each other’s working methods; they are more concerned that the public doesn&rsquo;t get an insight into their ways of doing business.  </p>

<p>Nor are developers likely to desert Southwark, just because one of them has to reveal a financial viability assessment. Viability assessments are made public in other circumstances, such as developer’ appeals against adverse planning decisions, and the profits to be realised from Southwark&rsquo;s advantages as a central London borough will remain a big attraction.</p>

<p>Lend Lease were fully aware of Southwark Council&rsquo;s 35% affordable housing policy when it pitched to become the development partner. It signed the regeneration agreement in 2007, which pledged to provide half of the affordable housing as social rented housing. It has successfully beaten down the amount of affordable housing to 25%, and it has successfully reduced the amount of social rented housing to almost zero - all on the strength of confidential dealings including the financial viability assessment.  The public have a right to see it. </p>

<h2>Linden homes see the light</h2>


<p><img class="right" src="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/1378318437_80.177.117.97.jpg" width="300" height="300">The successful planning application for the <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7066">Linden Homes development</a> at St. Georges Circus was accompanied by the usual financial viability assessment pleading poverty. On this occasion however - and much to its credit - Southwark Council refused to accept this plea, and at the twelfth hour planning permission the developer discovered he could provide more affordable housing after all.  Notwithstanding the other merits of the application (there were many local objections) this shows what can be achieved when you stand your ground. Let&rsquo;s hope Southwark learns the lesson. </p>

<h2>To demolish or not to demolish……</h2>


<p><img class="left" src="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/1305725970_80.177.117.97.jpg" width="400" height="300">Southwark’s announcement last week that the shopping centre was to be demolished caught everyone by surprise, including the shopkeepers judging by <a href="http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,26548,185,00.htm">local newspaper reports</a>. The headlines emphasise the demolition and Cllr Fiona Colley is quoted saying that it has been agreed with owners St Modwen and the Greater London Authority.  St Modwen seems less sure – it just says that they remain committed to redevelopment and delivering a viable scheme.  Southwark has the alternative of compulsory purchase if needs be, but that could be a bruising battle.</p>

<p>Like the Heygate estate, the shopping centre has always been viewed as an obstacle by the champions of regeneration and from their point of view demolition makes sense.  St Modwen failed in their bid to become the regeneration partner and hasn’t engaged with the local community at all about their ideas, so Southwark Council cannot be blamed for asserting itself against them.  But just as on the Heygate the interests of the current occupants seem to be incidental.  The shopkeepers and the stall holders that cluster around the centre serve the people who live at the Elephant now, but are in the dark about what is going on.  Doesn’t the future include them?</p>

<p>The decision to demolish or not should not be left just to the big guns. Shopkeepers and the local community must be allowed their say.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/images/diewelt.png" width="300" height="300">Last week German national newspaper <em>Die Welt</em> <a href="http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article119060642/Grossbritannien-auf-dem-Weg-zum-Armenhaus-der-EU.html">featured</a> this picture of the Heygate as a symbol of Britain&rsquo;s social decline and the <em>&ldquo;Krieg der Reichen gegen die Armen&rdquo;</em> - the war of the rich against the poor.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/LLhereandnow.png" width="300" height="200">By coincidence Lend Lease have just submitted a <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeDocs&amp;TheSystemkey=9550740">planning application</a> featuring the same image but with a more promising message: <strong>change and transformation - <em>Here and Now</em> </strong>. Lend Lease were no doubt inspired by the prominent piece of graffiti either side of the banner, and it must also know that in Latin <em>Here and Now</em> means &lsquo;hic et nunc&rsquo; - the immediate satisfaction of desire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_phrases_(H)">according to Wikipedia</a>. Lend Lease&rsquo;s desire for profit is being satisfied pretty immediately: <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7047">it expects</a> to draw its first profit from the E&amp;C development in 2016, while the Heygate development as a whole is not due to be completed until 2025. Globally it reported a profit of £320m ($553 AUD) in its <a href="http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20130823/pdf/42hvw1dsw9q47d.pdf">annual report</a> last week.</p>

<h2>Here and Now 2</h2>


<p><img class="right" src="http://www.newmarkpi.com/images/D_07_l.jpg" width="300" height="200">Chatelaine House on the Walworth road is yet another proposed development in the Elephant &amp; Castle opportunity area that doesn&rsquo;t fulfill affordable housing requirements. The <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeResultDetail&amp;TheSystemkey=9549289">planning application</a> is for 54 homes plus 5,000m2 of shops, offices and restaurants. There will be only 14 &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; units - 10 social rented and 4 intermediate, equating to around 25% of the total number of new homes. The target date for the planning decision was the end of this month. There is no officer&rsquo;s report yet on the application, so it is not clear whether the social rented units will be at council rent levels or the new so-called &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; rents of up to 80% market.</p>

<p>The viability assessment for the Chatelaine House development was prepared by <a href="http://www.upsidelondon.com/">&lsquo;Upside London&rsquo;</a>, a consultancy formed just a year ago with the motto &lsquo;Making Development Viable&rsquo;. The company doesn&rsquo;t have a website yet, so we can&rsquo;t see whether it features <a href="http://www.s106management.co.uk/how-it-works">images of developers wheeling away barrows laden with cash</a>. <em>Upside London</em> was joined by dozens of other property developers, estate agents and public sector representatives at a <a href="http://www.peoplesrepublicofsouthwark.co.uk/hold-news/mqt/files/category/12-planning?download=189:planning-in-london-conference-afternoon">recent conference</a> on achieving viable developments in London. Looking at its title <em>&ldquo;Very taxing: Is viability vanishing as charges and levies hit London development?&rdquo;</em> it would seem that all participants think that London is very lucky to be getting any affordable housing at all.</p>

<h2>Come on Eileen!</h2>


<p><img class="left" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2435/3878668654_0e7f08204c_z.jpg" width="300" height="200">The latest in the never-ending round of consultation about Eileen House ended yesterday. The <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/73440_1.pdf">original application</a> was made in Feb 2009 and was rejected for having no social rented housing and not enough shared-ownership housing. The <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeResultDetail&amp;TheSystemkey=9531326">updated application</a> is worse: it still has no social rented housing, it has reduced the shared-ownership units by 15 units to 65, and has increased the private units by the same number from 255 to 270.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>£18m public money spent but no social rented housing</h2>


<p><img class="right" src="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/elephant_and_castle_360tower_web.jpg" width="300" height="200"><br/>
Boris Johnson has just announced that the UK&rsquo;s largest private rental development will be right at the heart of the Elephant &amp; Castle. The <em>360 Tower</em> on the old London Park Hotel site will provide 462 new homes, most of which will be for free-market rent. 188 will be &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; but mostly shared ownership, and a meagre 29 units - initially social rented - have since been <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/MD1240%20Newington%20MD%20Part%201%20PDF.pdf">turned into so-called &lsquo;affordable rent&rsquo;</a>. Needless to say that this is way below the 80 social rented units required by planning policy, and way beyond the means of most people living in Southwark<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. Today&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/tenancies/major-flaws-revealed-in-pay-to-stay-policy/6528085.article"><em>Inside Housing</em> article</a> reveals that the minimum salary needed for an &lsquo;affordable rent&rsquo; flat in Southwark is £46,790 pa.</p>

<p>Of the 188 &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; units 159 will be shared ownership. We have no information about how much they will cost, but Southwark Council&rsquo;s income threshold for shared ownership is currently around £30,000 per year for a 1-bed flat.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.the-latest.com/sites/default/files/images/12_1.jpg" width="300" height="200"><br/>
<strong>The past&hellip;</strong><br/>
The site was formerly home to the London Park Hotel, which provided low-cost accommodation including accommodation for asylum seekers. It was <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3475">bought by</a> Government agency &lsquo;English Partnerships&rsquo; for £18m in order to provide affordable housing for key workers. The current development was given planning permission by Southwark Council in 2007. The developers were then First Base, <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/2835">part of the Lend Lease consortium</a> selected as the council&rsquo;s E&amp;C development partner. The site then passed hands from English Partnerships to the Homes and Communities Agency and finally to the GLA. Along the way First Base dropped out, the overall amount of affordable housing was reduced and then the commitment to provide key-worker housing was dropped in January 2010. <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3475">In 2008</a>, chair of Southwark&rsquo;s planning committee James Gurling noted the <em>&ldquo;&lsquo;dreadful irony&rsquo; that the Government had spent millions of pounds acquiring the site – part of it from Southwark Council – for housing for people who can&rsquo;t afford it and now the committee was being asked to back a reduction in the number of such homes. A lot of money has gone round in a big circle and the net losers will be the people who need the help most.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>&hellip; and the future</strong><br/>
<img class="right" src="http://www.housingexcellence.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/large_490x270/public/Archway.jpg?itok=OXcNjsbc" width="300" height="200"><br/>
The <em>360 Tower</em> is now being funded by <a href="http://www.m3cp.com/">M3 Capital Partners</a> - a global real-estate investment company originally part of the Australian <a href="http://www.macquarie.com/">Macquarie group</a>. The tower will be managed by its subsidiary company <a href="http://www.essentialliving.uk.com/"><em>Essential Living</em></a> whose <a href="http://www.essentialliving.uk.com/">aim it is</a> to <em>&ldquo;revolutionise the private rental market&rdquo;</em>. <em>Essential Living</em> has recently become very active in Britain and has <a href="http://shbm-news.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/essential-livings-bethnal-green-scheme.html">5,000 new homes in its planning pipeline</a>. One of its projects is the controversial Archway Tower, and <em>Essential Living</em> <a href="http://www.housingexcellence.co.uk/news/london%E2%80%99s-archway-tower-become-rental-homes-gentrification-plan">makes no bones</a> about what its aim is: <em>&ldquo;Archway deserves regeneration and we believe our investment will be the catalyst to further gentrification in this important North London community.”</em></p>

<p> In a <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmcomloc/writev/953/prs125.htm">recent submission</a> to a parliamentary inquiry <em>Essential Living</em> asked for:</p>

<ul>
<li>The continued sale of public land to the private sector</li>
<li>Limits to lifetime and fixed-term tenancies for affordable housing</li>
<li>A relaxation of s106 contributions</li>
</ul>


<p><em>Essential Living</em> offers itself as an alternative to buy-to-let landlords who they <a href="http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/rogers-stirk-harbour-tower-to-be-a-uk-first/5058596.article">describe as amateurs</a>, but it admits that the costs of building, maintaining and managing their homes in the new American style setup will be more expensive, and is asking for changes in the way the viability of its developments is assessed within the planning process. Large developments must provide public benefits through <a href="/blog/2013/07/30/how-to-avoid-providing-affordable-housing-a-guide-for-developers/">s106 contributions</a>; these will be reduced if <em>Essential Living</em> gets its way.</p>

<p>Mayor Johnson thinks that M3 capital partners are the perfect new landlords. He hopes they will start a trend: <a href="http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/rogers-stirk-harbour-tower-to-be-a-uk-first/5058596.article">he said:</a> <em>“This ‘holy grail’ of investment in the riskier pre-development stage is a hugely important milestone but it is just the beginning. I want to entice other institutional investors to come forward and invest in quality homes for Londoners.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Essential Living?</strong><br/>
<em>Essential Living</em> do not appear to have any completed developments where we can see what their rent levels are, but if the so-called &lsquo;affordable rents&rsquo; are going to require an income of £46,790 per year, then we can confidently predict that the free-market rents won&rsquo;t come cheap.</p>

<p>Private rental and &lsquo;affordable rent&rsquo; don&rsquo;t feature anywhere in the policies or plans for the regeneration of Elephant &amp; Castle, but the <em>360 Tower</em> and <a href="/blog/2013/08/03/the-whole-world-comes-to-the-elephant/"><em>One the Elephant</em></a> show us that both will play a significant role, and that much of the regeneration&rsquo;s housing will be neither affordable nor owner-occupied. The Elephant &amp; Castle regeneration - Europe&rsquo;s largest regeneration scheme - is quickly becoming a property-investment bonanza, one moreover that is being funded through the disposal of public land.

<div id="appeal">
<h2>Stop the Press!</h2>
It was confirmed on Friday by the Information Tribunal that Southwark Council have appealed against the <a href="/blog/2013/07/24/heygate-figures-must-b-be-revealed-information-commissioner/">Information Commissioner&#8217;s decision</a> to order Southwark to disclose the Heygate masterplan viability assessment, submitted by developer Lend Lease in its planning application. Southwark have requested a hearing at which they will argue that while they <a href="http://youtu.be/sbSCIuaLFQ4">believe in openness and transparency</a>, on this occasion it would be best if the public was kept in the dark.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The start of work on <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6463"><em>One the Elephant</em></a> was marked with some ceremony this week by developers Lend Lease, including a visit by the mayor of London Boris Johnson. However it was a bit unfortunate for both him and Southwark Council that the symbolically important development has no affordable housing.</p>

<p>The event was covered by ITV and the BBC:</p>

<iframe width="350" height="197" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/c0tgOPOI1IE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>




<iframe width="350" height="197" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/WZRV4KMxuEk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>




<iframe width="350" height="197" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/uRSorzbUH94" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>The TV reports emphasised the lack of affordable housing. Mayor Johnson and Councillor Colley responded with the well-rehearsed defence that <em>One the Elephant</em> was providing a leisure centre instead, and that 1600 &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; housing units will be provided elsewhere in the regeneration.</p>

<h2>Affordable Housing?</h2>


<p>However, as was revealed at the recent CPO inquiry<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, less than half of these 1600 so-called &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; homes will be social rented - a net loss of around 500 after the loss of the Heygate estate. The affordable housing also includes part-buy/part-rent and over 200 units at the new iniquitous &lsquo;affordable rent&rsquo; at 50% market rent. Neither of these are options that are really affordable for the vast majority of people who need housing in Southwark. As this blog has repeatedly emphasised - social rent is the kind of affordable housing that Southwark needs most, yet it is precisely the kind that the Elephant regeneration is destroying.</p>

<p>In the ITV interview, Councillor Colley also referred to Southwark Council&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1301/council_bucks_national_trend_and_promises_vast_increase_in_number_of_council_houses">recent pledge</a> to build 10,000 council houses over the next 30 years. This pledge is very welcome and we hope to see it fulfilled, but affordable housing was to be one of the key benefits of the Elephant &amp; Castle regeneration, and these are homes that should be being built now.</p>

<h2>Profit in Leisure</h2>


<p><img class="left" src="http://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk/public/assets/news_articles/2013/05/1367907090_elephant--castle-leisure-centre---cgi.jpg" width="300" height="200">The leisure centre in lieu of affordable housing will cost around £20m<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>. Lend Lease&rsquo;s contribution to this is £3.5m<a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>. Has the sale of the land to Lend Lease generated the £17m shortfall? In any event Lend Lease got a good deal - the required 35% affordable housing contribution would have been around 100 units, and at £300k each<a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a> this would have cost Lend Lease £30m.</p>

<h2>Overseas and Off-Plan</h2>


<p><a href="/images/TrafalgarPlaceCN.png"><img class="right" src="/images/TrafalgarPlaceCN.png" width="400" height="300"></a> The BBC report also focused on the amount of free-market housing that Lend Lease is selling off-plan overseas for buy-to-let investment. Neither Boris Johnson nor Fiona Colley could say how much this would be, but if <em>One the Elephant</em> follows the <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/605cdea2-fb69-11e2-a641-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2auDlY5Ft">trend of 75% going overseas</a> then there will only be 70 units for British-based buyers who are wealthy enough to afford them.</p>

<p>Another recent <a href="http://youtu.be/7yuT3RlR1Zc">BBC report</a> also addresses the overseas buyer issue and local MP Simon Hughes initiated an <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/house-of-lords-22992949">adjournment debate</a> in the House of Commons where he gave his own ideas about how to solve the problem.</p>

<h2>Those who have had to leave us</h2>


<p><a href="/images/EveningStandardHeygateResidentsForcedOut.pdf"><img class="left" src="/images/EveningStandardHeygateResidentsForcedOut.png" width="200" height="390"></a>In an <a href="/images/EveningStandardHeygateResidentsForcedOut.pdf">Evening Standard article</a> respected journalist Mira Bar-Hillel focuses on those who have had to leave the Elephant to make way for the regeneration.</p>

<p>We covered this briefly in our <a href="/blog/2013/06/08/the-heygate-diaspora/">recent blog post</a>. The Standard article puts some faces to the statistics and shows what the regeneration has really been about for these former local people.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since our <a href="/blog/2013/07/24/heygate-figures-must-b-be-revealed-information-commissioner/">last blog post</a> we have been asked to explain more about viability assessments - also known as viability reports. These are a developer&rsquo;s analysis of the finances of their own scheme, and if this self-assessment demonstrates to the council&rsquo;s satisfaction that the scheme is not financially viable, then the developer is able do duck out of providing affordable housing.</p>

<p>As can be imagined, nearly all developers opt to submit a ‘financial viability assessment’.</p>

<p>In planning terms affordable housing is known as a section 106 obligation, and producing viability reports for developers is big business. These companies all provide the service:</p>

<p><a href="http://residential.joneslanglasalle.co.uk/residential-services/consultancy-services/affordable-housing.aspx">Jones Lang Lasalle</a>  -   <a href="http://www.hamptons.co.uk/land-and-new-homes/developer-services/viability,-affordability,-housing-section-106-(1)/">Hamptons</a>  -   <a href="http://www.wilkinsongrant.co.uk/land-a-development/confidential-property-register">Wilkinson Grant</a>  -
<a href="http://www.savills.co.uk/services/planning-and-development/planning/planning-policy/development-viability.aspx">Savills</a></p>

<p>For between £1,000 - £3,000 <a href="http://www.s106management.co.uk/">&lsquo;S106 Management Ltd&rsquo;</a> will produce a viability report that reduces or eliminates your affordable housing obligation. You can then take a holiday with the money that you have saved or pile it into your wheelbarrow as their website illustrates:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.s106management.co.uk/"><img src="/images/s106management2.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Viability reports are confidential, they are not made public and even members of the planning committee do not see them. They have to rely on the recommendation of planning officers (who in turn rely upon an assessment by the District Valuer’s Service).</p>

<p>So the <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/HeygateFOICommissionersReport.pdf">Information Commissioner&rsquo;s decision</a> to order the release of Lend Lease&rsquo;s viability report for the Heygate masterplan is a significant one. He particularly emphasises the importance of transparency in planning matters, and the need to maintain public confidence in the authority&rsquo;s decisions.</p>

<p>Southwark is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbSCIuaLFQ4&amp;feature=share&amp;list=UU1yTdlADczSqDS-DsEliI8A">committed to transparency</a>, it must now accept the Commissioner&rsquo;s decision and release the report.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="http://evacpack.co.uk/ICO.jpg" width="300" height="200">Southwark Council have been ordered to disclose the financial viability assessment provided by developer Lend Lease to secure the approval of its Heygate masterplan application. This assessment justified the reduction in the affordable housing requirement from 35% to 25% and the reduction of social rented housing to just 71 units.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/viability_assessment_for_plannin#incoming-304798">Freedom of Information request</a> for the viability assessment was rejected by Southwark Council, but the council&rsquo;s decision has now been overturned by the Information Commissioner who has given Southwark 35 days to produce the assessment.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/HeygateFOICommissionersReport.pdf">Commissioner&rsquo;s report</a> is a closely argued and detailed 35-page document. It draws upon previous decisions made both by the Commissioner and the Information Tribunal to come to its conclusions.</p>

<p>The Commissioner&rsquo;s judgement was that there was a <strong>&ldquo;very significant weighting in favour of disclosing the information&rdquo;</strong><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, and that <strong>&ldquo;The public interest in disclosing the information outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exception.&rdquo;</strong><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> i.e. keeping the information confidential. The Commissioner acknowledged that disclosing the information was detrimental to Lend Lease&rsquo;s commercial interests, but did not think that Southwark Council&rsquo;s own commercial interests were relevant. He also acknowledged that Lend Lease were entitled to confidentiality, but thought that the greater public interest was served by the disclosure. Additional factors that gave increased weight to his argument included <strong>&ldquo;any perception that an authority might not be acting in accordance with its own policies&rdquo;</strong>.<a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a> In addition he cited<a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The scale of the scheme (£1.5bn over 15 years)</li>
<li>The number of Heygate residents affected by the scheme (3,000) and subject to rehousing and Compulsory Purchase Orders.</li>
<li>The loss of council-owned property through sale of public land to a private enterprise.</li>
<li>The costs incurred to date by the council in taking the scheme forward (£47.9m)</li>
<li>Public concern about the level of affordable housing provided by the scheme and how this sits with the council&rsquo;s Core Strategy.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY</strong><br/>
The Commissioner refers several times to the high level of public interest in the development:</p>

<blockquote><p>In relation to the general public interest in transparency and accountability, the Commissioner’s general view is that, where this relates to planning matters, there is a strong weighting in favour of encouraging public participation and disclosure is a means of promoting this.</p><footer><strong>Information Commissioner&#8217;s Report</strong> <cite>Paragraph 167</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>He notes the press and television attention that the development has received, and considers that the focus of public debate and concern has been on the levels of affordable housing provision delivered by the scheme. Disclosure of the viabilty assessment would inform this debate and reassure the public that the council&rsquo;s decision to allow Lend Lease’s proposals to proceed were based on a correct analysis of the facts presented.</p>

<p>He also notes the concerns raised by various community groups and on websites such as <a href="http://southwarknotes.wordpress.com">Southwark Notes</a>, <a href="http://35percent.org">35percent.org</a>, and <a href="http://www.spinwatch.org/index.php/issues/more/item/5458-the-local-lobby-and-the-failure-of-democracy">Spinwatch.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>BEST CONSIDERATION?</strong><br/>
<a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/HeygateFOICommissionersReport.pdf"><img class="left" src="/images/HeygateFOICommissionersReport.png" width="200" height="400"></a>The Commissioner also considered that the disposal of the land and its sale price were matters of <strong>&ldquo;relevant public interest&rdquo;</strong>. He acknowledged the difficulties of obtaining best value in the current economic climate, and the argument that the council should be allowed to simply press on with the regeneration. However, he comes down on the side of what he calls a <strong>&ldquo;compelling countervailing argument in favour of making this process as transparent as possible&rdquo;</strong>. He considers the <strong>&ldquo;size of the redevelopment and the number of residents affected should provide a trigger for transparency and engagement with council tax payers&rdquo;</strong><a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>, and that the council should expect a <strong>&ldquo;high level of scrutiny&rdquo;</strong>.<a href="#footnote-6">[6]</a></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Commissioner notes that the scheme will not deliver the level of affordable housing required by the council’s own core strategy. In this respect alone, there is a significant public interest in demonstrating to the public that the council’s decision to progress with the scheme is nevertheless justified.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Information Commissioner&#8217;s Report</strong> <cite>Paragraph 100</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p><strong>A LANDMARK DECISION?</strong><br/>
Southwark can demonstrate its commitment to transparency and accountability by accepting the Commissioner&rsquo;s decision without further ado. There will be more viability assessments submitted in the future - local councillors, planning committee members, and members of the general public must be able to see them, particularly if council policy is not being fulfilled. It is ridiculous that the masterplan planning application was passed blind by the planning committee - it dents Southwark Council and Lend Lease&rsquo;s credibility, and local people&rsquo;s confidence in the regeneration process.</p>

<p>The South London Press <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/SouthLondonPress23July2013.pdf">reports</a> that Southwark maintains that the assessment should not be made public and that it is <strong>&ldquo;seeking further advice to determine its best course of action&rdquo;</strong>. Every one of our elected councillors - regardless of which party they are in - should say different and insist that the viability assessment is released without further delay.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;With the increasing outsourcing of public services and disposal of public assets to private partners or third parties, the Commissioner considers that there is a growing need for transparency and accountability in authorities’ decision-making and expenditure, not least because many parties which authorities conduct business with will not themselves be subject to the EIR or FOIA.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Information Commissioner&#8217;s Report</strong> <cite>Paragraph 171</cite></footer></blockquote>

<p><img class="right" src="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/418865_406280396101674_377969546_n.jpg" width="300" height="200">It is not surprising that Mr Pickles approved Southwark&rsquo;s application. The decision is taken on the basis that the estate is now empty and takes little account that it was once the home to 3,000 people. Mr Pickles decided that it was in the public interest for the development to proceed rather than to allow the leaseholders to keep their homes. The leaseholders&#8217; responses can be seen in this <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-23371735">BBC report</a>.</p>

<p>The decision was the result of a 4 day public inquiry in February this year. Some points in Inspector Wenda Fabian&rsquo;s <a href="/images/Heygate_CPO_Inspectors_Report.pdf">conclusions</a> are worth noting:</p>

<p>She says <em>&ldquo;The quantity of the social rented accommodation on the site of the former estate would be dramatically reduced, some 71 units compared to the 750 formerly existing.&rdquo;</em> The Inspector goes on to note that the &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; rented homes would be provided at higher levels of rent than were current on the estate.</p>

<p>She also says that the evidence given by various academics (Prof. Loretta Lees - King&rsquo;s College, Michael Edwards - UCL, Mara Ferreri - Queen Mary University) were a <em>&ldquo;matter of wider social policy consideration&rdquo;</em>, rather than a particular consideration for the inquiry. This evidence showed that regeneration schemes displace those people whose deprivation was the justification for the regeneration, and that low-income residents do not benefit from mixed communities - they lose the economic and social advantages of living in a low-income communitiy.</p>

<p>The Inspector addressed the vexed question of the scheme&rsquo;s financial viability. She noted that <em>&ldquo;although commercially sensitive viability figures were not produced for the Inquiry&rdquo;</em>, she did not doubt that Lend Lease would fulfil its commitments because <em>&ldquo;the reputational consequence for Lend Lease of a market failure on this site so close to the City of London would be substantial&rdquo;.</em></p>

<p>In relation to viability, the Inspector allowed the need for 616 new car parking spaces despite the requirements set out in policy that there should be none.</p>

<p>The Inspector had little doubt that the shopping centre situation can be resolved. She says <em>&ldquo;its regeneration by the current owner is still feasible and Lend Lease is cooperating in the redevelopment project discussions on this basis.&rdquo;</em> Since it has been just <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6937">been reported</a> that the owners of the shopping centre are now considering its sale unless Southwark approves its development plans <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6808">(so far resisted)</a>, it remains to be seen whether this confidence is justified.</p>

<h2>What Next?</h2>


<p>The council will now write to the objectors and inform them of the decision. After two months, ownership of the homes will transfer to Southwark Council.</p>

<p>The council will then serve a further notice and occupants will have 28 days to vacate the property. If they do not do so, the council is entitled to take steps to gain possession.</p>

<p>Following vacant possession, leaseholders will then finally have the opportunity to refer the valuation of their homes to a Lands Tribunal if they still disagree with Southwark&rsquo;s offer of compensation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="http://www.artslondonnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DSCN7813.jpg" width="300" height="200">Six months after the appearance of 48 large shipping containers on the forecourt of the former Shell garage on the Walworth rd by the Heygate estate, a planning application for their uses has finally appeared. It has been submitted by &lsquo;Artworks&rsquo;, who were chosen to provide interim uses on the Heygate site during the period of its redevelopment. The model for the boxpark is a scheme in Shoreditch. The proposal is for studios, bars, business/workspace, retail, markets, cafe/restaurant, gallery, community, and &lsquo;stay-work&rsquo; uses for a maximum 5 year period.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://notesonallure.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_4547.jpg" width="500" height="350"></p>

<p>The application is generating a lot of interest while raising a lot of questions. Artworks say that it will generate job and education opportunities while helping to animate that part of the Walworth road. However, local people are concerned of what the impact will be on what is also a residential area. There are also doubts about the feasibility of the proposals: the application says that the rents will start at £50 per week, but we know from the marketing information reproduced below that the full cost of a &lsquo;live-work&rsquo; container is £200 per week plus bills.</p>

<p>Artworks are offering &lsquo;Short-term living accommodation for business operators&rsquo;<a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a> - but the containers are too small to meet Southwark&rsquo;s policy requirements<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> for live/work use; which is probably why Artworks have called them &lsquo;stay-work&rsquo; units in the application rather than &lsquo;live-work&rsquo; units in their marketing material. Any application for more than 10 units of residential accommodation would also trigger the requirement for 35% affordable housing.</p>

<p>The temporary nature of the development might relieve Artworks of the obligation to provide the usual s106 contributions, which mitigate the adverse consequences of developments by providing such things as local facilities and training. Artworks say that these benefits will come from the scheme anyway; Southwark planning has asked for more detail to demonstrate that this will be so, and that the scheme will actually provide the jobs it hopes to. It has also asked whether any of the units will provide any affordable retail/business space<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>The green space in front of Swanbourne will also be part of the boxpark. Artworks say that <em>&ldquo;The open space will be available for use by the public other than when it is being used for specific and occasional private events.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>All in all, this seems like a largely commercial development some way removed from the original idea of interim uses as providing space for productive voluntary activities. The application might have its merits, but it should be judged on these alone.</p>

<p>If you wish to make a comment on the application, you can send this by email to planning.applications@southwark.gov.uk, quoting the planning application reference: 13/AP/1224. <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeResultDetail&amp;TheSystemkey=9549395">Here is a link</a> to the full planning application documents.</p>

<h2>The Boxpark Vision</h2>


<p>Artworks may have just got their application in but they are not wasting any time advertising the containers. Below is a response to an email enquiry regarding the boxpark. The price for the container units is a lot clearer than it is in the planning application. £50 per week gets you a market stall, £150 - £170 per week gets you a work space, and full live-work container will set you back £200 per week plus bills. But hurry!</p>
