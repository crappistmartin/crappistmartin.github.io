  <div class="entry-content"><p>There was no sound of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial_of_Peter">cock crowing</a>, but when asked in a recent radio interview if it is correct that there would only be 79 social rented units on the new Heygate, council leader Peter John replied &lsquo;no&rsquo; three times.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ENIkTjE0XB8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>However, while Councillor John does go on to say that the 3 bed affordable units for rent will be at council rent levels, he cannot bring himself to say that there will only be 79 of these, as we can see in the document pages below.</p>

<p><a href="/images/ahframework2.png"><img src="/images/ahframework2.png" width="310" height="450"></a><a href="/images/schedule6.png"><img src="/images/schedule6.png" width="310" height="450"></a></p>

<p>These are Appendix 4 and schedule 6 respectively of the two s106 agreements covering the Heygate site. They are legal agreements that detail how much public benefit the developers will provide, including affordable housing.</p>

<p>Like many such agreements they are not always clear to ordinary people, but look carefully at the highlighted areas and you can see the figures 71, 6 and 2 - making a total of 79 three-bed homes (i.e. council or social rent levels).</p>

<p>Councillor John also says that the 1&amp;2 bed affordable homes for rent will be at 50% market rents (there will be 212 of these). But at 50% of market rent, affordable rent is no substitute for social rent. <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/eip-ema-15_LB_Southwark_Matter2_Appendix%20A.pdf">&lsquo;Southwark Council&rsquo;s Response to the London Plan Revised Minor Early Alterations consultation in June 2012&rsquo;</a> shows this very clearly: in SE17 at 50% market rent the average weekly rent across all unit sizes is £194, while the median weekly income of a council house tenant is £174.</p>

<p>We can also see from the s106 agreements, that there will be a total of 291 affordable homes for rent, either affordable rent or social rent - much fewer than the 700 Cllr John says will be available during the interview. The difference is made up by 296 part buy-part rent units, which Cllr John doesn&rsquo;t mention at all.</p>

<p>The Heygate estate had 1200 social rented units, there will now be 79. Southwark has 20,000 households on its housing waiting list. They should be Southwark&rsquo;s priority but none will be housed in the new Heygate.</p>

<h2>Heygate Happiness</h2>


<p></p>

<p>In the same interview, Cllr John also paints a rosy picture of the rehousing of former Heygate residents. He says that the vast majority have moved into brand new homes and are delighted. In fact the vast majority have simply been moved into existing council house stock elsewhere in the borough, and only 45 have moved to brand new homes. This was conceded by Southwark Council at the recent <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/CPOPressRelease.pdf">public inquiry determininig a Compulsory Purchase Order</a> on the remaining leaseholders on the Heygate estate.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8221;__5.16__ &#8230;the Acquiring Authority agreed that tenants leaving from this point onwards were entitled to a right to return to new build affordable housing property built through the early sites programme or secured through a development within the core area [via a s106 agreement] for a period of up to seven years. Subsequently 250 tenants entered into such an agreement with the Acquiring Authority. To date 45 former Heygate Estate tenants have chosen to return to a new home made available through this process.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Statement of Evidence, CPO Public Inquiry 5th Feb 2013</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/8171/proofs_of_evidence__jon_abbot__final_proof'>www.southwark.gov.uk/download/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>




<h2>Returning to Nowhere</h2>


<p>Cllr John also mentions the <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/righttoreturn.pdf">&lsquo;right to return&rsquo;</a> in his interview. This supposedly enables former Heygate residents to return to the new properties on the Heygate estate.</p>

<p>This was only offered to the secure tenants on the estate (only around 600 by the time of the decant in 2007). It expires on 30 Sep 2015. Only 8 social rented units and only 54 affordable units of any kind will be built by then. Above all, there will only be 79 social rented units in the whole development - whenever it is finished.</p>

<p>Leaseholders won&rsquo;t fare any better: the levels of compensation offered for their homes does not allow them to buy in the area, let alone at the prices quoted for <a href="http://trafalgarplace.com/">Trafalgar Place</a> - the first phase of the new Heygate - which start at £310,000 for a one bedroom flat.</p>

<p>Worst off of all were the insecure tenants. Southwark stopped issuing secure tenancies in January 2001, and <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/HeygateActionPlan.pdf">by 2007</a> there were over 400 insecure tenants. By the <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Housing%20Scrutiny%20Committee/20080123/Agenda/December%2011update.pdf">time of the decant</a> there were still around 300 temporary tenants. These were not given the right to return option at all.</p>

<p>All in all, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what kind of resident you were, the chances of you getting back on the Heygate are very very small.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;There should have been new homes built for residents before they moved. That didn&#8217;t happen. But they&#8217;ve got the right to return. In reality, though, few will come back to the social housing on the new site.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Councillor Fiona Colley</strong> <cite>Cabinet Member for Regeneration</cite></footer></blockquote>

<h2>Heygate Was Home</h2>


<p>Finally, according to Cllr John the Heygate was also a <b><em>&lsquo;by-word for social failure, crime and antisocial behaviour&rsquo;</em></b>. Former residents beg to differ and have set up a website in an attempt to set the record straight: <a href="http://heygatewashome.com">www.heygatewashome.com</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/plazagone1.jpg" width="350" height="220"> An eagle-eyed member of the local community has noticed that the <a href="/images/TribecaHoardingsLicence.jpg">licence that allows the hoarding</a> surrounding the Tribeca Square site - formerly known as Oakmayne Plaza, <a href="/images/volvocpo.jpg">formerly known as the Volvo garage</a> - has expired. Perhaps the licence has since been renewed, but the hoarding stretching from the New Kent road down Elephant road to the Walworth road, has been a great nuisance and inconvenience to pedestrians since 2006.
After a spurt of on-site activity in 2009 progress has halted.</p>

<p>Oakmayne Director, Martin Lent has recently said that Oakmayne intends to return to Southwark planning to &lsquo;tweak&rsquo; their application before work re-commences. What this means remains to be seen: the <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3641">original application was comprehensively tweaked</a> so that no affordable housing would sully the development. In return, Oakmayne was going to build a huge basement, which was to house the MUSCo &lsquo;subterranean servicing complex&rsquo; between the Heygate and the shopping centre. Now that the <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5052">MUSCo has been ditched</a>, there will be plenty of room for some affordable housing in the development - even if it is in the basement.</p>

<iframe width="350" height="197" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bIlzq9g1u8c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>




<h2>Viability Trumps All</h2>


<p>An <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/viability_assessment_for_plannin#outgoing-205692">FOI request refused by Southwark Council</a> over a year ago, has now been partially conceded. The request asked for the viability assessment for the Heygate masterplan application, and was referred to the Information Commissioner after Southwark&rsquo;s refusal. The Commissioner has now said that Southwark is willing to release some of the information requested. We don&rsquo;t know how much and how useful this information will be, but we are looking forward to seeing it.</p>

<p>Developers use viability assessments to relieve themselves of the obligation to provide affordable housing. They are supposed to be objective but in fact are highly contested, as this extract from the GLA report for the aforementioned Oakmayne development from 2007 shows:</p>

<p><img src="/images/gla.jpg"></p>

<p>Councillors on Southwark&rsquo;s planning committee - the people who actually take the decisions - are not allowed to see viability assessments, despite their critical importance. This is not the case in all boroughs: some like Haringey and Lewisham allow councillors to view them, albeit with certain conditions. Whatever information we will receive, we will be more than happy to share.</p>

<p><strong>Re-phasing the Heygate</strong><br/>
The Heygate estate development <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6817">is to be re-phased</a>. The next two phases were due to comprise 1940 homes on the main site north of Heygate street adjoining the Oakmayne site and shopping centre. The next phase is now to be of 360 homes on the south side of Heygate street site adjoining Wansey street. This is welcome to Wansey street residents, who will see that part of the development completed first rather than last within the 15 year scheduled development cycle. It might also make better commercial sense for Lend Lease to hold off from the main development, given the uncertainty surrounding the shopping centre and Oakmayne developments.</p>

<p>Consultation on the Wansey street phase <a href="http://www.elephantandcastle.org.uk/pages/news_events/215/elephant_castle.html">has now begun</a> and the planning application is expected to be submitted in September.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/heygatephases.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Shopping Centre</strong><br/>
Southwark&rsquo;s Liberal Democrat opposition has <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6808">called for the Compulsory Purchase of the shopping centre</a>. This is a possibility we raised in our previous blog post, but there is little doubt that the owners of the shopping centre, St. Modwen would contest such an action vigorously and have the firepower to do so effectively. There is also the impact on the retailers and shopkeepers in the centre to be considered. On the other hand, Southwark council needs to be able to exert some sort of pressure on St Modwen, or otherwise the whole regeneration will be held hostage by them. St Modwen also needs to overcome its reluctance to engage with the wider community about its plans for the centre.</p>

<p>We note Cllr Fiona Colley&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6808">comments on the SE1 website</a>, and are happy that she is pushing for a better deal. But this is a conversation we should all be part of: what is the offer on the table from St Modwen? And what is it that Southwark is demanding from them?</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;So far, in our discussions with St Modwen, we have not been presented with a plan for the shopping centre that we believe delivers the right solution for local people or the area especially concerning appropriate levels of affordable housing.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Fiona Colley</strong> <cite>Cabinet Member for Regeneration</cite></footer></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="http://www.urban75.org/photos/london/images/lon520.jpg" width="300" height="200">
Mystery abounds about what is happening with the Elephant &amp; Castle shopping centre. An article purporting to give the latest information on www.costar.co.uk was removed from their website after only a day. But the google cached version can still be <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:www.costar.co.uk/en/assets/news/2013/April/600m-Elephant--Castle-shopping-centre-plans-on-hold/">viewed here</a> If the article is accurate it looks like nothing will be done until 2014 at the earliest; shopping centre owner St. Modwen/Salhia promised a planning application by the end of this year. It seems that St. Modwen and Southwark cannot agree on the amount of housing the development should have: St. Modwen want 1,000 new homes but Southwark council want no more than 500. No details are given of how much affordable housing either option would provide.</p>

<p>It is worth remembering that the redevelopment of the shopping centre was considered the critical element for the success of the Elephant &amp; Castle regeneration. It was to provide the &lsquo;destination&rsquo; retail units that were to attract affluent shoppers to the area, and along with private housing would raise the general level of local prosperity. After Southwark signed the regeneration agreement with Lend Lease in July 2010, it did consider the &lsquo;nuclear&rsquo; option of compulsory purchase of the shopping centre, but in the event a deal was struck with St. Modwen, making them something like a third partner to the regeneration.</p>

<p>Southwark awaits the decision of its recent <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/CPOPressRelease.pdf">Compulsory Purchase Order</a> for of Heygate leaseholders. If it is granted, will Southwark&rsquo;s success embolden it to revisit this option for the shopping centre?</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/1311085254_80.177.117.97.jpg" width="300" height="200">Deputy Mayor for Transport Isabel Dedring, also appears to have a different idea for the shopping centre if the reference to its demolition is accurate. St. Modwen favour refurbishment and redevelopment of the existing structure. The uncertaintly surrounding the remodelling of the northern roundabout and the northern line upgrade are also big factors. A feasibility study of the roundabout&rsquo;s peninsularisation is due to appear this month. Agreement is still pending for the funding of the northern line tube station capacity upgrade.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Objectors are fuming after being refused entry to Tuesday&rsquo;s public hearing for the Heygate masterplan planning application.</p>

<p>Over 40 local residents including members of the Wansey Street TRA, representatives from the Elephant &amp; Castle&rsquo;s Latin American traders and local priest Grahame Shaw were refused entry to proceedings at the council&rsquo;s Tooley St. headquarters.</p>

<p>A total of 102 seats had been allocated for the hearing, but objectors arrived to find that around half of these had already been taken up by representatives from the developer and the council&rsquo;s regeneration &amp; property divisions.</p>

<p>With Southwark&rsquo;s largest ever planning application and 300 objectors, a room with maximum capacity for just 100 people had been allocated to the hearing. Southwark&rsquo;s Head of Corporate Programmes told waiting objectors that the meeting is full, and that if people put their names on a list then they would be admitted on a one-in, one-out basis. He apologised to objectors and explained that <em>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t expecting to completely sell out&rdquo;.</em></p>

<iframe width="350" height="197" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rHUSIcLIons" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Councillor Bukola subsequently <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU4VFcLvJ3Y&amp;">emerged from the meeting to tell</a> excluded objectors that <em>&lsquo;there are a sufficient number of objectors already in the room&rsquo;</em>&hellip;.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/aU4VFcLvJ3Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Fellow objector and MP Simon Hughes later arrived to find objectors barred from the meeting, and immediately <a href="https://twitter.com/swklibdems/status/291277257664770048?uid=0&amp;iid=am-165485524613583391288878247&amp;nid=57+452">tweeted Peter John</a> to complain about the situation.</p>

<p>After much debate with officials, the planning committee&rsquo;s legal officer finally intervened and the meeting was forced into recess. The 30 or so objectors who had stayed in the lobby, were then finally admitted at around 9pm - 3 hours into the hearing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/planningcommittee3.jpg"></p>

<p>Those objectors who had been fortunate enough to gain entry at the beginning of the meeting, made the most of the <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2013/01/02/heygate-application-will-objectors-get-a-fair-hearing/">ridiculous 5 minutes allocated between them</a> in which to make their representations.</p>

<p>Among these were Jerry Flynn speaking on behalf of the Elephant Amenity Network and Adrian Glasspool representing the Heygate residents.</p>

<p>In answer to questions, Flynn made a number of points including: concerns surrounding the large number of car-parking spaces proposed; privatisation of public realm; lack of clarity in the developer&rsquo;s promise to retain some of the trees; lack of any renewable energy. His major two concerns though, were the masterplan proposal for just 79 social rented homes, and whether the scheme was actually financially viable - the report on the scheme described it as representing a <em>&lsquo;very big risk&rsquo;</em> for the developer.</p>

<p>Glasspool objected that Heygate residents had originally been promised new homes in the development, but that the 79 social rented units proposed wouldn&rsquo;t be sufficient to honour this pledge: <em>&ldquo;An entire community has been ousted on the back of false promises that there would be a right to return.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/planningcommittee2.JPG" width="400" height="300">Frustrated that such little time had been allocated for objectors to speak, some residents had prepared placards outlining their concerns. Planning Committee chair Cllr Nick Dolezal immediately halted proceedings and ordered those holding placards to leave the room.</p>

<p>The meeting reconvened after Dave Walker from <a href="http://southwarkmediation.co.uk">Southwark Mediation Service</a> was able to persuade objectors to lower their placards. Those privy to the proceedings witnessed the expected approval after the committee accepted Lendlease’s assurances that they could indeed deliver the scheme despite the risk. The application went on to be approved with councillors predictably voting along party lines, with the exception of Cllr Crookshank-Hilton who abstained.</p>

<p>Jerry Flynn&rsquo;s reaction to the decision was emphatic: <em>&ldquo;This is very bad news for anyone desperate for a home in Southwark.  The so-called ‘affordable rent’ homes will be half market rent, at least £50 a week more expensive than council rents – how could anyone who used to live on the Heygate afford that?. There are more planning applications for the Heygate in the pipeline – they must be rejected unless they have cheaper social rented homes.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Simon Hughes summed up the decision <a href="http://audioboo.fm/boos/1157878-simon-hughes-reaction-to-heygate-decision#t=2m17s">in an interview</a> with <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6545">London SE1</a> <em>&ldquo;Sadly, many people will go short of affordable housing in and around the Elephant because the council weren&rsquo;t tougher with the developers. It is not surprising that there was - peaceful - civil disobedience when so many people feel so strongly that this does not deliver the housing and the balanced scheme, which they have fought for for so long.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Chris Mead, Chair of the Wansey Street Tenants and Residents Association issued the following comment: <em>&ldquo;As Chair of the Wansey Street TRA, I am furious that a number of Wansey Street residents (myself included) were barred from the Heygate master-plan committee meeting on Tuesday evening. Wansey Street directly borders the Heygate development area, and residents have genuine and reasonable concerns about aspects of the planning application; those concerns continue to be ignored and remain without receiving a satisfactory answer. Despite receiving over 200 objections from the wider community, less than 50 seats were provisioned for the public at the largest planning application review meeting in Southwark Council&rsquo;s history. At the least, this was incompetent by Council Officers and the meeting&rsquo;s Chairman, or at worst, a contrivance to exclude the public from what is supposed to be a transparent and democratic process.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/showustheviability.jpg"></p>

<p>SE17 resident Marie Cane was one of the objectors holding up placards - she explained: <em>&ldquo;the committee gave us just 5 minutes for 300 objectors to state their case. This is particularly shameful as this is the largest planning application ever submitted to the council. We have been silenced by the council, so we decided to stage a silent protest. We simply wanted committee members to remember the Council&rsquo;s own policy requirements. We are not against change; all we want are guarantees built into this masterplan - guarantees that the council would have required on any other development in the borough.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><img src="http://www.peoplesrepublicofsouthwark.co.uk/images/stories/news/heygatein01.jpg"></p>

<p>Objectors had proposed a number of planning conditions upon this application, i.e. that the park should be managed by a trust, that a detailed RPA survey should be undertaken for the trees, etc.</p>

<p>It was not made clear at the end of the meeting which of these, if any, were adopted.</p>

<p>We were expecting a sell out, but - in the words of Southwark&rsquo;s Head of Corporate Programmes: <strong>we weren&rsquo;t expecting a complete sell out..</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Weak finances, minimal social rented housing, a privatised public realm, vague energy proposals, environmentally suspect  and  car-friendly – the masterplan application for the regeneration of the Elephant and Castle has finally arrived after 13 years waiting.</p>

<p>The application is the largest ever submitted in the history of the borough: it has taken 9 months to process and is accompanied by over 200 supporting documents. It is also the most inequitable - offering just 71 social rented units out of 2,300 new homes.</p>

<p>Around 300 local residents have submitted objections to the application, which is due to be heard this Tuesday 15 January- 6pm at the council&rsquo;s offices in London Bridge (160 Tooley st).</p>

<p>Having been allocated <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2013/01/02/heygate-application-will-objectors-get-a-fair-hearing/">just 5 mins for all objectors to voice their concerns</a> during the hearing, the Elephant Amenity Network has sent a briefing document to councillors in the hope that they will take up the issues that can&rsquo;t be covered in the 5 minute slot. You can <a href="/images/PlanningCommitteeBrief12AP1092.pdf">download a copy of the briefing document here..</a> and read a summary of the points we wish to raise below.</p>

<p>The planning committee is a public meeting and anyone concerned about the future of our city and environment is encouraged to attend.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/viability.png" width="300" height="200"><strong>Financial Viability</strong><br/>
* Doubts about the financial viability of the scheme<br/>
* How will the ‘viability gap’ in the scheme be bridged?<br/>
* How will we avoid the Heygate becoming yet another stalled development site?<br/>
The viability of the scheme is described as ‘problematic’ (para. 151) and refers to a ‘viability gap’ representing &lsquo;very big risk&rsquo; on the part of the applicant (para. 153). The Phase one Heygate application states: “The level of affordable housing proposed represents a level that is currently above what is indicated as being viable.”  Non-viability of the scheme is also listed in the council&rsquo;s risk register as one of the major impediments to the scheme going ahead.</p>

<p>How is the viability gap between the viable level of affordable housing at 9.4% and the 25% (para. 150 &amp; 153) offered being bridged while maintaining the financial stability of the scheme?</p>

<p>The London Park Hotel and Oakmayne Plaza(Tribeca Square) sites were granted planning permission six years ago; these sites remain undeveloped. There is no reference to the time schedule for the delivery of the detailed planning applications in the report. We propose that a condition be attached to any approval of the application requiring a fixed schedule of applications.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/affordable.png" width="400" height="300"><strong>Housing</strong><br/>
* Lack of social rented housing<br/>
* Phasing of the affordable housing delivery<br/>
The scheme will provide only 71 social rented units out of a total 2,300 new homes (para. 159). This is in breach of Southwark Council&rsquo;s planning policy, which would require approx. 400 social rented units. 198 affordable rent properties are also being provided, but they are not affordable for many residents of the borough.</p>

<p>Affordable rent is also not a type of social rented housing. Both the National Planning Policy Framework and draft revisions to the London Plan have social rent and affordable rent as separate categories of affordable housing (with intermediate housing as a third category). A consortium of 9 boroughs including Southwark supported this position at the London Plan examination in public in November 2012. Therefore affordable rent units cannot be used to meet the social rented proportion of the affordable housing required by policy. The application should therefore be rejected on these grounds.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/affordableseventeen.png" width="300" height="200">
The first two tranches of the six tranches of the scheme only deliver 20% affordable housing (para. 156). This means that the first 1,200 units of the scheme will only provide 20% affordable housing. This should be changed so that 25% minimum is delivered from the beginning of the scheme.</p>

<p>An initial review of the affordable housing delivery is proposed only after two years beyond the first approved application (para. 154). We are also concerned that the conditions for changes in phasing will not be strong enough to ensure that the development is delivered in a timely fashion (para. 35).</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/animals.jpg" width="300" height="200"><strong>Public Realm</strong><br/>
* The reduction in amount of green and open space<br/>
* The private management of the park<br/>
* Maintaining real public accessibility of the park<br/>
* Highway Authority concerns about Estate Management Company control<br/>
The park will be managed by a private Estate Management Company (EMC). The park should be designated public open space and if not Council managed, a trust should be considered as an alternative, instead of a Parks Advisory Group (paras 326 &amp; 380)</p>

<p>We note the comments made by the Highway Authority that the Estate Management Strategy assumes management of the existing areas adopted by the EMC (Appendix 2 - para. 11). We share the Highway Authority&rsquo;s concerns and object to the public realm appearing to move into private hands.</p>

<p>We note the Highway Authority&rsquo;s comments quoted here and support its proposals for alternative management and enforcement regimes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;General concern is raised about the proposed number of new private streets (unadopted highways) within the application given the likely impact on the council’s ability to control the network and manage the boroughs streets and spaces for the benefit of residents, businesses and the travelling public.  If this course is pursued then it is strongly recommended that robust alternative management and enforcement regimes are included in any consent.&rdquo; (Appendix 2 - Para. 11)</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/cars.jpg" width="300" height="200">
<strong>Car Parking</strong><br/>
* Contrary to Southwarks car-free policy<br/>
* Reduce the number of car-parking spaces</p>

<p>The development is not free of car parking as originally envisioned and set out as policy by Southwark in the E&amp;C SPD. If the scheme is not to be free of car parking, a condition should be created which sets it at a lower rate than the up to 27% of units having car parking (plus motorcycle parking plus car club places) that is currently being demanded.</p>

<p>616 car-parking spaces are proposed for the scheme (para 225) despite Council policy requiring it to be car free.  The Elephant has the highest possible public transport accessibility rating (PTAL 6b) so why are so many car-parking spaces needed?
Strata Tower which has been completed has car parking set at 14%, the consented Oakmayne development 11%. Most recently St Mary’s Residential was granted at 16% (8% disabled and 8% private). If parking is to be allowed it should be at a far lower rate.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/trees.jpg" width="300" height="200"><strong>Trees</strong><br/>
* Concern about caveat on retention of existing trees<br/>
* Unnecessary removal of trees<br/>
* Highway Authority recommendation for tree planting<br/>
The applicant proposes to remove 283 and retain 123 of the 406 existing trees (para. 336). The retention of the 123 trees is compromised by a caveat deferring to detailed surveys (Root Protection Area – RPA surveys) due to be carried out during later design stages.(Tree Strategy 1 of 8, Page 22, Paragraph 6.4)</p>

<p>These RPA surveys should be carried out now and a firm commitment given to retention of trees. A greater number of trees should be considered for retention, especially those on the north side of Heygate St. for which there appears to be no clear grounds for their removal.</p>

<p>We note the objection made by the Highways Authority that the proposed streets will be too narrow to give sufficient space between buildings for newly-planted trees to grow adequately. We support the Highway Authority&rsquo;s recommendation: &ldquo;It is recommended that the minimum critical distance for streets be increased to 12m in all instances. In the absence of this it is unlikely that street trees and other planting will be accommodated adequately;&rdquo; (Para. 11 - Appendix 2)</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/sustainability.png" width="300" height="200">
<strong>Sustainability</strong><br/>
* Lack of sustainable alternatives<br/>
* Unrealistic energy centre connection proposals<br/>
* Unfeasable biomethane fuel proposals<br/>
This scheme was chosen by Bill Clinton as a global example of zero carbon development. The scheme aimed to produce enough on-site renewable energy to supply the entire Elephant &amp; Castle area. This aim has since been abandoned and the application fails to propose any on-site renewable energy whatsoever, contrary to Southwark&rsquo;s policy which requires 20% minimum.</p>

<p>We note that the application considers biomethane gas for its on-site renewable energy requirements. We don&rsquo;t believe that this an acceptable proposal for reasons that the report itself notes, including:
Biomethane is not classified as an on-site renewable energy source therefore it cannot meet Southwark&rsquo;s policy requirements (para. 411)
There is currently no supply of biomethane available in the UK (para. 410)
The applicant is not proposing to generate any biomethane gas, and makes no firm commitment to purchase any should it become available in the future
We propose that the 20% on-site renewable energy requirement is met using a combination of the alternatives listed in paragraph 406.</p>

<p>We note the report&rsquo;s comment that through planning permission additional plant can be installed to accommodate additional capacity (para. 404). We request that a planning condition is applied upon granting the application accordingly: The new Energy Centre should be constructed such that it has sufficient capacity to supply all of the surrounding developments as identified in the Energy Strategy.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/cyclists.png" width="300" height="200"><strong>CYCLING</strong><br/>
* Inadequacies of proposed new routes<br/>
* There is no proper transport assessment<br/>
* There is no proper connection to strategic routes<br/>
The cycling proposals fail to take sufficient account of the deaths and injuries cyclists have suffered around the Elephant and Castle. It is proposed to widen the northern roundabout, which will increase traffic flow. The new cycle connection suggested between Brandon St and Meadow Row is not more ‘direct’ as the officer&rsquo;s report claims, and ignores the key connection with the crossing at Falmouth Rd.
A CS6 cycle route through the Heygate site and the needs of commuter cyclists are not being considered in this application.</p>

<p><strong>S106/Community Infrastructure</strong><br/>
* Potential net loss of 1,500 sq metres of community facilities
transport infrastructure spend      <br/>
The Heyate comprised a total of 2,500 sq metres of community facilities; the scheme proposes a minimum of just 1,000 sq metres. The minimum should be increased to 2,500 sq metres so that there is not net loss in community facilities.</p>

<p>The transport infrastructure spend is still insufficient to fund improvements to the tube station and northern roundabout.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/jobs.png" width="300" height="200"><strong>Employment/Retail</strong><br/>
* Will the London Living wage be paid for employment on scheme?<br/>
* There is no long term commitment to affordable retail units for existing small and independent traders who are likely to be displaced<br/>
* There are no targets for jobs for local residents post construction<br/>
* There is no information on how many of the affordable retail units will be available for displaced local retail businesses.<br/>
Those employed in construction jobs on the scheme should receive at least the London Living wage.
We note the minimum construction jobs target for local residents (para. 376) We would like to see a similar minimum target for local residents post construction (para. 135). A definition of the area of local benefit is also needed.
We note that the legal agreement will secure 10% of affordable retail space which will be prioritised for existing SMEs in the E&amp;C OA. However, it is understood that this may be limited to a term of just 5 years, thereby failing to provide long-term security for small retailers.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/gatedcommunity.png" width="300" height="450"><strong>Place Making</strong><br/>
* The size of the large retail units at ground floor are too large<br/>
* The scale, height and form of the buildings need to create a positive sense of place<br/>
* Cafes and other amenities need to be affordable<br/>
The footprints of the ground floor retail spaces are considerably larger than that of many of the surrounding local businesses. The building form should create a larger number of smaller units. This would increase permeability, enrich the public domain and encourage local businesses to connect with the development.</p>

<p>The area around the base of the Strata tower is an example of how the public realm can become marginalized through the impact of tall buildings. The scale, height and massing of the proposed development should be reconsidered.</p>

<p>The proposed cafes around the green space may not be affordable to all local people, and will therefore fail to create a truly human sense of place and inclusiveness for the neighbourhood. Smaller scale community focused businesses should be integrated within the proposals.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="http://www.elephantandcastle.org.uk/files/176.img.jpg?20121026085510" width="300" height="200">The biggest planning application ever submitted to Southwark Council is due to be heard by its planning committee on 15 January - the Heygate outline masterplan (12/AP/1092). It has taken Southwark 9 months to evaluate this huge application with more than 350 supporting documents, and objectors are frustrated that they will only be given 3 minutes between them to voice their concerns.</p>

<p>The 35% Campaign and other objectors have made the very reasonable request that they be given more time - so far without any success.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/masterplan1.jpg?w=300&h=228">There are well over 200 objectors to the masterplan application; if they all wished to speak at the hearing, then they would have less than a second each to voice their objections.</p>

<p>This is plainly ridiculous: whatever one thinks of the merits of the application, one of this size should not be determined after only hearing 3 minutes worth of objections. It makes for bad decision making and discredits the whole process.</p>

<p>We have cited examples of similar scale developments where other councils have made changes to procedure in order to accommodate the volume of objectors, but Southwark council refuse to follow suit: around 300 objections to the Ward&rsquo;s Corner development saw <a href="http://www.minutes.haringey.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=27397">Haringey Council give objectors 30 minutes</a> in which to make their representations to the Committee; a similar number of objectors to the King&rsquo;s Cross regeneration development saw <a href="http://35percent.org/images/KingsCross12AP1092.pdf">Camden Council spread the planning committee hearing</a> over 3 entire evenings.</p>

<p>Southwark council&rsquo;s defence for this absurd approach is that objectors can rely upon committee members asking all the right questions after hearing the objectors. Past experience shows this is not always the case. Quite often committee members who don&rsquo;t wish to engage in debate simply stay silent.</p>

<p>It is not too late for this to change, and we hope that Southwark has a change of heart between now and January 15th. If you think this is unfair and want to add your support to our request to extend the 3 minutes, you can email the Chairman of the planning committee: Cllr. Nick Dolezal - <a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;&#110;&#x69;&#x63;&#x6b;&#46;&#100;&#111;&#108;&#101;&#x7a;&#97;&#x6c;&#64;&#x73;&#x6f;&#117;&#116;&#x68;&#119;&#x61;&#114;&#x6b;&#46;&#103;&#111;&#118;&#x2e;&#x75;&#x6b;&#46;">&#x6e;&#105;&#99;&#107;&#x2e;&#100;&#111;&#x6c;&#101;&#122;&#x61;&#108;&#64;&#x73;&#111;&#x75;&#x74;&#104;&#x77;&#x61;&#x72;&#x6b;&#x2e;&#x67;&#x6f;&#x76;&#x2e;&#117;&#107;&#x2e;</a></p>

<p>Questions are naturally being asked whether taxpayers will see any of this money back from the council&rsquo;s deal with development partner Lend Lease. According to <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/Appendix_8.pdf">this report</a> from the council&rsquo;s Finance Director in 2007, the deal with Lend Lease involves them reimbursing the council £20m towards the £32m cost of buying out the leaseholders on the estate, £20m towards demolition costs, and a fixed payment for the land of £10m.</p>

<p>So the council is set to receive a total of £50m reimbursement for site assembly, once the Heygate site has been cleared and handed over to Lend Lease - [by which time the council is likely to have spent much more on the task]. The rest of the money the council is expecting to receive from the deal is based on a &lsquo;profit share&rsquo; agreement, otherwise known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land-sale_overage">&lsquo;overage&rsquo;</a>. However, it is important to understand that this 50% share of the profits comes only AFTER Lend Lease has taken a 20% &lsquo;priority share&rsquo; of the profits and a 4% management fee.</p>

<p>So it remains to be seen whether there will be anything left for the council at all in 2026 when the Heygate development is due to be completed.</p>

<p>These &lsquo;profit share&rsquo; or &lsquo;overage&rsquo; agreements are notoriously precarious, and can be subject to disputes over accounting methods - such as the dispute erupting in Sydney last week, where Lend Lease is being <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/valuation-dispute-poses-threat-to-1b-return-from-barangaroo-20121206-2ay9e.html">taken to court by state authorities</a> over expected land payments for its Barangaroo development. Overage agreements can also be compromised by delays to development, such as with Lend Lease&rsquo;s Greenwich Peninsula scheme where the profit share expected from the scheme by authorities fell by £30m for each year the scheme was delayed. <a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0708/greenwich_peninsula.aspx">(National Audit Office Report – 14 July 2008)</a></p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/viabilityminutes.png" width="250" height="550">Exactly how much Southwark council is currently expecting to recoup from the profit-share agreement at the Elephant is unclear, as it has <a href="/blog/2012/07/03/its-all-about-financial-viability/">rejected all calls</a> to publish any financial details relating to the development.</p>

<p>If the expected profit share fails to cover the costs it has incurred in emptying the estate, and the money it will have to cough up for the tube station capacity upgrade to support the new development, then it could end up making a substantial loss on the disposal of its 24-acre primely located Heygate site.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Congratulations to the successful labour party candidate and new East Walworth ward councillor Rebecca Lury. Commiserations to Ben Johnson (Lib Dem) and Stuart Millson (Conservative).</p>

<p>On a cold night last Tuesday around 40 people attended an election hustings two days before polling day. The meeting was organised by Elephant Amenity Network and chaired by Dave Walker, of the Southwark Mediation Centre.  It was held at Crossway Church by kind permission of Rev Peter Stevenson.</p>

<p>The three youthful candidates – Stuart Millson (Conservative), Rebecca Lury (Labour), Ben Johnson (Lib Dem) – presented themselves and their arguments well.  Transport, road safety, shops, open space, home care provision were all discussed, but the Elephant regeneration, Heygate redevelopment and affordable housing provision were the main topics of debate.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, candidates stood by their party positions on these issues – Ben Johnson supported the demand for 35% affordable housing in all East Walworth developments; Rebecca Lury thought 25% was the best to be got on the Heygate for the moment, but hoped it could be improved over time; Stuart Millson, made the case for cheaper free market rented accommodation.</p>

<p>Questions from the floor were informed and to the point.  All three candidates gave their support to a proposed neighbourhood plan for East Walworth and to making the notorious ‘finanancial viability assessments’ more transparent;  these secretive reports determine how much affordable housing can be built in a development.</p>

<p>The clip below gives a flavour of debate at the meeting. Ben Johnson speaks first followed by Stuart Millson and then Rebecca Lury. The question they are answering is &ldquo;will they support the financial viability assessments for the Heygate redevelopment being made public?&rdquo;
Apologies for the poor sound quality.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>East Walworth by-election -</strong>
Labour, Lib Dem and even the Conservative activists have been energetically fighting for votes in the East Walworth ward in the run-up to polling day on Nov 29th.</p>

<p>The candidates&#8217; profiles were <a href="/images/SNCandidates2.png">featured in this week&rsquo;s Southwark News</a>. It is disappointing to see all three candidates toeing their respective party lines on Heygate affordable housing, rather than stating out an independent position: the Conservative says - get the money and spend it elsewhere; the Labour candidate says - it&rsquo;s as good as we can get, fingers crossed it will get better; and the Lib-Dem says - we can get more (but doesn&rsquo;t say how). East Walworth needs to be represented by councillors who are prepared to put the interests of their constituents above party loyalty. The only way we are going to get any more affordable housing out of Lend Lease is by making it plain that their current applications will be rejected at planning committee unless both the level of affordable housing is increased and that rented affordable is at council rent levels. That is the commitment local people are looking for from each of the candidates.</p>

<p><strong>Social rented housing is affordable but not all affordable housing is social rented -</strong>
We are strictly non-partisan so we cannot say which candidate does not yet know the difference between &lsquo;social rented&rsquo; and &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; housing. But they have been telling voters on the doorstep that the Heygate redevelopment will have 25% social rented housing. If only this were the case. As anyone who reads our blog will know, there is a big difference between the two: all social rented is affordable, not all affordable housing is social rented. &lsquo;Affordable rent&rsquo; is the most misleading kind of affordable housing and that is what all the 1-bed and 2-bed flats will be on the new Heygate. According to <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/SN800GBPaffordables2.pdf">recent research by Southwark News</a> £800 per month is what local estate agents estimate will be the affordable rent on Phase one.</p>

<p><strong>Local Election Hustings -</strong>
All the candidates have been invited to a hustings on Tuesday 27th November 7pm at the Crossway Church, New Kent rd. This is a public open meeting where electors get the chance to put their questions directly to the candidates. Topics will include not just the Heygate redevelopment but also East St. market, transport, open space, car parking, cycle routes, sustainability and green spaces. More information will be provided on this in the near future.</p>

<p><strong>Siege of the Elephant -</strong>
Alternatives to the profit-led scheme that Southwark are currently wrestling with, were discussed at a gathering of over 70 local people, housing activists and academics at Pembroke House on Saturday. Amongst many interesting presentations one was from a global architecture, design and consulting firm, who got an honourable mention for the Building Trust&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.buildingtrustinternational.org/homecompetition.html">&lsquo;HOME&rsquo; competition.</a></p>

<p>It shows how the Heygate could have been refurbished at £14,000 per unit and saved the 40,000 tonnes of embodied carbon that is going to be lost through the demolition of the estate.</p>

<p>While the proposal came in for some criticism, we think it is worth serious consideration and its time may yet come.</p>

<p><strong>Council Leader Scrutinised -</strong>
Eight pertinent questions were put to council leader Peter John and Councillor Veronica Ward about the financial viability of the Heygate redevelopment at last week&rsquo;s overview &amp; scrutiny committee meeting.</p>

<p>Amongst them were how much money is Southwark getting out of the regeneration agreement, and how much money is Lend Lease getting?</p>

<p>The committee would also like to know what St. Modwens plans to do with the shopping centre, and how the funding gap for the transport infrastructure is going to be bridged.</p>

<p>Last but not least, what kind of affordable housing was Southwark actually getting out of the deal, and why should it be any less than either the 35% that policy requires or the 25% that the regeneration agreement promises.</p>

<p>Councillor John <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6441">made an interesting comment</a> in his answers, that money paid in-lieu of building on-site affordable housing by other developers[S106 money] might be used to buy homes from Lend Lease to be let as council houses.</p>

<p>Councillor John further commented that <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m told it&rsquo;s not a very cost-effective way of doing things&rdquo;</em> and we can see why. On-site affordable housing is sold at a fixed unit price, much lower than market price. It would hardly make sense to effectively pay Lend Lease not to build affordable housing, using money other developers have given to Southwark because they haven&rsquo;t built any affordable housing either.</p>

<p><strong>Simon Hughes calls for transparency -</strong>
This week&rsquo;s <a href="/images/SNHughesFV.pdf">Southwark News also reported</a> that Simon Hughes has called for the financial viability assessments for the Heygate development to be made public.<br/>
It is becoming clear that these financial documents are critical to the future of the Elephant &amp; Castle redevelopment. The Heygate planning applications were due to go to committee in October, but have now been delayed until January. Such delays are not unusual but they usually mean that the developer and the planning department are in disagreement about a major aspect of the application.</p>

<p>Southwark Council are fully aware of the viability risks and has prudently listed them in its <a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/134246/response/332306/attach/3/E%20C%20Programme%20Risk%20Log%20Oct%202012.pdf">&lsquo;risk register&rsquo;</a>. Lend Lease successfully argued that they could only afford the equivalent of 12 affordable housing units at the St. Mary’s Residential tower block development, instead of the 90 units policy requires (paras 41, 42  officers report, below). This demonstrates their skill in using viability assessments to justify dropping the social benefits of redevelopment schemes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/stmary.png"></p>

<p>Making the financial viabilty assessment public would reassure the local community that this isn&rsquo;t going to happen on the Heygate.</p>

<p><strong>St. Mary&rsquo;s Residential Parties split -</strong>
The narrow approval of the planning application for St. Mary&rsquo;s Residential development revealed differences of opinion amongst the lib dems and labour parties: three labour councillors and two lib dems voted for the application, while two lib dems and one labour councillor voted against.</p>

<p>For - Councillors [Crookshank-Hilton(Lib Dem), Brown(Labour), Ahern(Labour), Dolezal(Labour)]</p>

<p>Against - Councillors [Merrill(Labour), Barber(Lib Dem), Morris(Lib Dem)]</p>

<p>Unlike other committees, the planning committee is not &lsquo;whipped&rsquo;. This means councillors vote on the merits of the proposal as they see them and cannot be directed in their vote by the party machines. It doesn&rsquo;t always happen that way though. So credit to the councillors who voted against.</p>

<p>Following objections to the Heygate Phase 2 outline planning application from the Elephant Amenity Network, developer Lend Lease issued an amendment to its Energy Statement.</p>

<p>The good green news is that there are two Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants proposed within the Energy Centre. These are acknowledged to be highly efficient and are the desired solution for modern energy requirements. The bad news is that CHP will only be meeting just over half of the total heating demand of the new development. The other half will be met by good old-fashioned gas boilers.</p>

<p>Biomethane gas would make this a greener option but the supply is still in doubt. It won&rsquo;t be produced on-site or off-site by Lend Lease. The gas will come from the national grid but will be paid for at a premium biomethane price: a bit like green tariff electricity. Whether you can get biomethane will depend on whether there is enough being injected into the grid. There are currently no operational biomethane plants injecting into the UK gas grid. Despite this, Lend Lease claim that there is a possibility that 15% of the gas supply could be supplied by biomethane by 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Future (Impossible) Connections</strong></p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/energy9.png" width="400" height="400">It is also a big shock to the 35% campaign that there is no guarantee that the Energy Centre on the Phase 2 Heygate development is going to be connected to the Phase 1 development. The separate Phase 1 application proposes having its own Energy Centre - again reliant on gas boilers with CHP providing just half of its total heating requirements. The outline planning application optimistically lists 14 other sites including Phase 1 that could &lsquo;possibly&rsquo; be linked at some future date. But this would only be possible by installing extra plant. However, questions still remain as to whether there is enough room in the Energy Centre for extra plant and who would pay for it.</p>

<p>Let us remember that <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/2270">the fabled &lsquo;MUSCo&rsquo;</a> was going to provide 10,000 homes with renewable energy. It was a pioneering scheme endorsed by Bill Clinton as a global example of &lsquo;carbon zero&rsquo; development. The ambitious plans proposed a biomass CHP plant generating green heat and power from organic waste. It was also going to provide a bore-hole for a green water supply and an automated vacuum waste collection system moving municipal waste through underground tunnels.</p>

<p>Now Lend Lease have submitted applications that propose no on-site renewable energy, and which barely connect one side of the estate with the other.</p>
