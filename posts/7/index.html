<p>The redevelopment of the Heygate estate is essentially a land sale to a private developer. The Council <a href="/images/SNarticle.png">get a capital receipt</a> for the land and the developer provides some infrastructure and community benefits. There is an assumed <a href="/images/spdprofit.png">profit to the developer of 20%</a> of the total costs plus the profit left over when all the new buildings have been sold. The community benefits that were originally supposed to be provided in return for the Heygate redevelopment <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/82420796/Southwark-Council-2004-Development-Framework">were to include</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>A new school</li>
<li>A new library</li>
<li>A leisure centre</li>
<li>Affordable housing</li>
<li>A MUSCo energy utility</li>
<li>Upgrades to local public transport</li>
</ol>


<p>Plans for the school and library have now been dropped, and the leisure centre is being developed in a <a href="http://londonist.com/2012/03/further-elephant-and-castle-plans-revealed.php">separate land-sale development</a>.</p>

<p>The Heygate site was also supposed to provide <a href="http://localhost:4000/images/southwark_50percentcopy.png">50% affordable housing</a> and a <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5052">MUSCo</a> - (a biomass energy generation plant), which was going to provide &lsquo;green&rsquo; heat and power for the whole E&amp;C and Walworth area including the proposed development at the Aylesbury estate. This was in line with the &lsquo;zero carbon&rsquo; objectives for the scheme, which proposed that the new developments would all be carbon neutral and enabled it to be <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6032">selected as one of Bill Clinton&rsquo;s Climate Positive Initiatives</a>.</p>

<p>Now these too have been dropped from the scheme: the outline planning application contains no minimum guarantee of any affordable housing, and the biomass Combined Heat &amp; Power network has been <a href="/blog/2012/06/26/environmental-impact-understatement/">dropped in favour of a standard gas-fired boiler</a>, which will only supply the new homes on the Heygate footprint.</p>

<p>Lend Lease acknowledges that these changes are a significant deviation from the original plan and also a breach of planning policy, but justifies this in its planning application by claiming that these are constraints imposed by the financial viability of the scheme:</p>

<p><strong>Sustainability</strong>
<em>“A number of other alternative renewable energy sources are considered in the strategy. However, they do not secure the quantum of CO2 savings that are anticipated through biomethane and impact on the commercial viability.&ldquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>Affordable Housing</strong>
<em>“The outline planning application commits to the Site delivering as much affordable housing as is financially viable.&ldquo;</em></p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/viabilityminutes.png">
It would therefore appear that financial viability is the key variable in the whole scheme and the main determinant of whether it will provide any community infrastructure at all.</p>

<p>Members of the local community have raised concerns about the proposed loss of community benefits from the scheme, and have <a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/viability_assessment_for_plannin#outgoing-205692">asked the Council to share information</a> about the scheme&rsquo;s viability. However, the Council has refused to make public any details concerning viability claiming that it is <em>&ldquo;likely to prejudice the commercial and economic interests of both the council and Lend Lease.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>All that has been released concerning viability so far is a <a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/financial_viability_of_proposed#incoming-288071">series of heavily redacted minutes</a> from Council meetings with Lend Lease and its planning consultants &lsquo;DP9&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The Government&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homes_and_Communities_Agency">Homes &amp; Communities Agency</a> has acknowledged these viability issues and has recently <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/sites/default/files/investment_and_planning_good_practice_note.pdf">published guidelines for local authorities</a> in responding to the economic downturn:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The HCA strongly encourages stakeholders to employ a transparent approach to considering viability. Transparent viability appraisals have the potential to remove the mistrust and suspicion that has often characterised negotiations around the viability of planning obligations sought by adopted planning policy.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The 35percent campaign urges Southwark to release information relating to viability testing, so that we can better understand why the scheme&rsquo;s original community benefits can no longer be provided.</p>

<p>We think this is especially important since <a href="/images/SNLLFraud12July2012.png">Lend Lease&rsquo;s recent conviction for serious fraud</a> in connection with a similar regeneration scheme in New York.</p>

<p>If you are a Southwark resident and wish to add your voice to this demand, you can do so by lodging an objection by following the instructions on the <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/485/planning_applications/686/comment_on_planning_applications/3">link here.</a> The planning application reference number is 12/AP/1092.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Elephant &amp; Castle regeneration has been hailed as a global example for sustainable growth. It has been declared an &lsquo;Energy Action Area&rsquo; by the GLA and in 2009 it was fortunate enough to be selected by Bill Clinton as one of 16 worldwide projects <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6032">signed up to the Clinton Climate Positive Development Program</a>, which aims to create &lsquo;carbon neutral&rsquo; urban development.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/csh.png">However, the <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/224079_1.pdf">Energy Statement</a> in the recently submitted planning application for the redevelopment reveals that the &lsquo;zero carbon&rsquo; target has fallen by the wayside and Lend Lease has missed the Clinton program&rsquo;s boat: All forms of renewable energy provision have now been dropped from the development proposals.</p>

<p>This is not just a blow for Southwark Council&rsquo;s administration and Lend Lease&rsquo;s sustainability credentials, but also a breach of planning law. Furthermore, if Lend Lease aren&rsquo;t able to rush all the detailed planning applications through before 2016 it will also be a breach of building regulations - National Building Regulations state that all new homes built from 2016 onwards must be built to zero carbon standards and therefore comply with Code Level 6 of the Code for Sustainable Homes (CSH):</p>

<p>Lend Lease&rsquo;s outline planning application proposes to build the new homes to CSH level 4 - the level 6 requirement is only binding on applications made from 2016 onwards.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/musco.jpg"><strong>The &lsquo;Fairly Tale&rsquo; Solution</strong><br/>
The original regeneration agreement included plans to provide a Multi-Utility Services Co. (MUSCo) renewable energy plant, which would be powered by a biomass CHP boiler fuelled by organic waste. The utility would provide environmentally-friendly heating, hot water and power to the Heygate redevelopment, the <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/1692">Heygate early housing sites</a>, <a href="http://www.building4change.com/page.jsp?id=473">the Strata Tower</a> and other new developments at the Elephant (<a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3641">Oakmayne</a>/<a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3475">London 360</a>/<a href="http://londonist.com/2012/03/further-elephant-and-castle-plans-revealed.php">Leisure Centre</a>). It was also <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=16241">going to supply</a> the new Aylesbury estate development and the existing Salisbury and Newington housing estates, making it the largest biomass-fuelled district heating network in London and reducing the overall carbon footprint by a total of 70% compared to gas-fired boilers. However, the <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5052">MUSCo plans were eventually dropped</a> from the Lend Lease Regeneration Agreement because the estimated costs were too high. The scheme had become &lsquo;a fairy tale&rsquo; according to Southwark&rsquo;s head of regeneration.</p>

<p><img src="/images/muscoarea.png"></p>

<p><strong>The &lsquo;Boiler House&rsquo; Solution</strong><br/>
<img class="right" src="/images/heygateboilerhouse.JPG">The replacement solution to the MUSCo is to replace the existing gas-fired boiler with a replacement gas-fired boiler. The existing gas-fired boiler on the Heygate supplied heat and hot water through a district heating network (DHN) to over 2,000 homes on the estate and the neighbouring Salisbury estate. This boiler has now been switched off, and the Salisbury estate DHN is currently being supplied by a temporary oil-fired boiler. According to the planning application, the replacement gas-fired boiler will only supply heat and hot water to the 2,500 new homes on the Heygate redevelopment. Its district heating network will not extend beyond the Heygate footprint - it will not supply the Salisbury estate, and will not be supplying telecoms, potable water, non-potable water, drainage, gas, fibre-optics and vacuum waste as the original MUSCo had planned to. Proposals to supply other estates and developments have been dropped, and all methods of supplying heat and water that rely on renewable sources of energy have been rejected on grounds of their <a href="/blog/2012/07/03/its-all-about-financial-viability/">cost impact on viability</a>. The existing standard gas-fired boiler and district heating network is being replaced with a new standard gas-fired boiler and district heating network - (albeit a smaller network comprising just the Heygate development).<br/>
<img src="/images/HeygateDHN.png"></p>

<p>The implications of this for the E&amp;C&rsquo;s &lsquo;zero carbon&rsquo; objectives are clearly far reaching, but putting these aside there is one further complication: Southwark Council has set a planning policy requirement that for all new major developments, 20% of the energy demand should be met by on-site renewable energy generation: <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/5823/adopted_core_strategy"><em>&ldquo;Major development must achieve a reduction in CO2 of 20% from using on-site or local low and zero carbon sources of energy.&rdquo;</em></a></p>

<p>The originally planned biomass CHP boiler would have met this on-site reneweables requirement several times over. However, Lend Lease&rsquo;s planning application states quite clearly that the &lsquo;impact on commercial viability&rsquo; i.e. the high capital cost of a biomass boiler is the reason that it has been rejected.</p>

<p>Lend Lease acknowledges in its Energy Statement that its application does not currently fulfill this 20% on-site requirement. It attempts to mitigate this by claiming that it will seek to source some of its gas requirement in future from renewable gas sources. It states that one possible future source of renewable gas may be procured from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogas">biomethane</a> plants located off site, which would work in the same way as green electricity currently does. However, the problem is that there is only <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11433162">one operational biomethane injection plant</a> in the UK and this supplies just 200 homes. The obvious solution of course would be to build one, and it goes on in the Energy Statement to come very short of saying that it will do so: <em>&ldquo;Lend Lease will seek to work with the GLA, SC and others to locate a biomethane generating plant in London. This could mean that waste from the proposed Development could be used as an energy source.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The Elephant Amenity Network are objecting to this application. We do not believe that the proposed development will contribute towards achieving the sustainability objectives set out in the local planning policy and the draft Elephant and Castle Master Regeneration Plan. In order to be acceptable, we are requesting that the current application is amended to include a firm commitment by Lend Lease - either to construct a biomethane generation unit or install a biomass CHP boiler, and to extend the DHN network to neighbouring estates and developments as was agreed in the Regeneration Agreement.</p>

<p>If you are a Southwark resident you can object to these plans. Just type your name, address and email address into the form below, and your objection will be sent directly to Southwark council&rsquo;s planning office. A copy of your objection will also be sent to your local ward councillors. It is best if you use your own words but we have suggested some for you to start with: <br/>

<p>Much weight has been placed upon the 25% minimum affordable housing in Lend Lease &amp; Southwark&rsquo;s regeneration agreement. We couldn&rsquo;t find it in the Masterplan application (12/AP/1092) and the case officer confirmed its absence from the housing and planning statements. However, there is a reference to the 25% in the application, found courtesy of Soundings and Lend Lease: if you look very carefully you can find it in the <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/224053_1.pdf">draft S106 Heads of Terms document</a>.</p>

<p>S106 refers to the money developers pay to improve local amenities and provide community benefits when their planning applications are approved. It can be cash or in kind and it covers the provision of affordable housing. We had a close look at the Heads of Terms document to see what it tells us:</p>

<p><img src="/images/S106.jpg"></p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/S1062.jpg"> </br>
Under the 3rd column heading shown on the left there is an absence - instead of a figure we have a dash. We not quite sure what this means, but we note that in all other categories of S106 expenditure precise figures are given.</p>

<p></br></br></br>
<img class="right" src="/images/S1063.jpg"> Under the 5th column shown on the right we can see Lend Lease does intend to provide affordable housing on site, but in the 6th column, which should tell us the total amount of this contribution there is nothing. Again, in all other categories of S106 expenditure precise figures are given.</p>

<p><img src="/images/S1064.jpg"></p>

<p>The critical part of this last column is the first sentence: <em>&ldquo;The outline planning application commits to the Site delivering as much affordable housing as is financially viable in line with planning policy.&rdquo;</em> The sentence omits that planning policy requires a minimum level of affordable housing of 35% - only when a developer thinks it cannot meet this requirement do they submit a financial viability assessment to determine how much they can build. The final sentence is a simple restatement of what is in the regeneration agreement -<strong> it is not a legally binding condition of the planning application.</strong></p>

<p>The only other reference to the level of affordable housing to be provided can be found in the planning application&rsquo;s <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/225206_1.pdf">Supplemtary Planning Statement</a> below. We can see from this that a financial viability assessment has already been conducted, so both Lend Lease and Southwark also have an idea of just how much affordable housing this development can sustain. We think they should share this information with us.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>30 May 2012</p>

<h2><strong>Local residents demand to know &ldquo;How much affordable housing are we getting?&rdquo;</strong></h2>

<p>Southwark Council and Developers Lend Lease have been provoked into <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/200183/elephant_and_castle/2045/elephant_and_castle_regeneration_agreement/1">reiterating their commitment</a> to a minimum guarantee of 25% affordable housing by the 35% campaign.</p>

<p>The 35% campaign aims to secure 35% affordable housing promised by Southwark Council&rsquo;s planning policies. There is no guaranteed minimum included in the Heygate Masterplan outline planning application(12/AP/1092). Southwark Council claim that the outline application does not need to have the minimum guarantee and that it will be included in future detailed applications.</p>

<p>Jerry Flynn, spokesperson for the Elephant Amenity Network (EAN) said <em>&ldquo;It beggars belief that Lend Lease should not say how many affordable houses they will be building in the outline planning application. The most important question for local people about this development is - will we be able to live there? &lsquo;wait and see&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t a good enough answer. This application will set the benchmark for the detailed applications and without it the minimum could well be zero - just like <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3641">Tribeca Square</a> and the <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5896">Leisure Centre development</a>.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The EAN is leading the call for Southwark Council to send the application back to Lend Lease and tell them to include the 35% minimum guarantee of affordable housing set out in the <a href="http://35percent.org/images/Core_Strategy_82.pdf">Council&rsquo;s planning policy</a>.</p>

<p>It is also pressing the council to make public the confidential financial viability assessment that Lend Lease submitted with its planning application, so that the local community can see for itself why it says it hasn&rsquo;t the money to build 35% affordable housing (see pg. 6 of the Supplementary Planning Statement).</p>

<p>The EAN has mounted the 35% campaign - <a href="http://35percent.org">www.35percent.org</a> - to hold Lend Lease to Council policy and ensure that at least 800 of the new homes are affordable. It is demanding that the planning application (ref- 12/AP/1092), due for decision in OCT 2012, is rejected.</p>

<p>NOTE: The Elephant Amenity Network is a community group made up of local residents and traders campaigning for open planning, open access to green and recreational spaces and 50% truly affordable housing.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Southwark Council and Lend Lease signed a regeneration agreement including the redevelopment of Heygate estate footprint in July 2010. The development of the footprint will be in two phases - the Heygate masterplan for phase 2 (12/AP/1092) including 2,400 new homes has just been submitted. The development will also include retail, business, leisure and community facilities.</p>
