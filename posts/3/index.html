  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Information Tribunal latest:</h3>


<p>The scheduled 5 day hearing of Southwark Council’s appeal against the <a href="http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2013/fer_0461281.ashx">Information Commissioner’s order</a> to release the viability assessment for the Heygate redevelopment will now run into a sixth day. The Tribunal will reconvene on the 18 February to hear final submissions from barristers.  The viability assessment details why developers Lend Lease cannot deliver the 35% affordable housing required by Southwark’s housing policy, as well as failing to fulfil other policy objectives such as providing a car-free development.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://thecreativeconsultancy.com/clients/competition-appeal-tribunal/media/steps.jpg" width="300" height="200">The Tribunal has heard arguments from barristers for Lend Lease and Southwark that disclosure would, amongst other things, be in breach of Lend Lease’s human rights and copyright of its intellectual property.  Further, it would give an insight into its business methods and an undeserved advantage to its competitors.  On top of this other developers might be put off doing business with Southwark and other London local authorities, if they saw that a fellow developer’s viability assessment was being laid bare. Concerns were also raised about the impact of disclosure on the viability of the Heygate scheme itself and the potential for delay this might cause. Senior officers from Southwark, Lend Lease and GLA gave evidence in support of the case.</p>

<p>On the other side of the arugment was the Information Commissioner and former Heygate resident Adrian Glasspool (the original requester), who argued that Lend Lease’s plan to build only 71 social rented units and its failure to deliver the minimum 35% affordable housing, had given rise to a great deal of public disquiet, reflected in extensive media comment; it amply justified disclosure of the viability assessment, which weighed heavily in the public interest. Witnesses included members of the Elephant Amenity Network, writer and campaigner George Turner, planning and regeneration expert Dr Bob Colenutt and Cllr Adele Morris of Southwark’s planning committee. Cllr Morris argued that disclosure would save the council from further reputational harm: <strong> <em>“Much has been made of the harm to Lend Lease if this ‘commercially sensitive’ information is made public, however I pointed out that much reputational harm has already been done to the council by keeping this information covered up. The more the council fights to keep it secret, the more suspicious people become.”</em> </strong></p>

<p>Amongst many documents examined by the Tribunal, the planning committee report of 15 January 2013 came under much scrutiny. This report recommending approval of the scheme said that it only became viable at 9.4% affordable housing. It also had an extensive appendix of local objections, focussing not just on the lack of affordable housing but also the over-provision of car-parking and failure to provide any on-site renewable energy.<br/>
It was also revealed that Lend Lease no longer shares information on the finances of the scheme with its development partner Southwark as it had done before the information request, but now provides a ‘data room’ for council officers to visit instead.
The Tribunal reconvenes on 2nd Feb at 2pm - Court 2, <a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Competition+Appeals+Tribunal,+Victoria+House,+Bloomsbury+Place,+WC1A+2EB&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=51.48931,-0.08819&amp;sspn=0.668689,1.234589&amp;hq=Competition+Appeals+Tribunal,+Victoria+House,&amp;hnear=Bloomsbury+Pl,+London+WC1A,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">Competition Appeals Tribunal (Victoria House, Bloomsbury Place, London. WC1A 2EB)</a>.</p>

<h2>Heygate MP1 –  360 new homes, 17 social rented</h2>


<p>Coinciding with the Tribunal hearing was the planning committee hearing for the first of the detailed planning applications under the Heygate masterplan. Approval was waved through for 360 homes - 284 free-market, 55 shared ownership, four affordable rent (at 50% market rent) and 17 social rented.  The seventeen social rented units equals the number of on-street car-parking spaces provided for the new private town houses, to spare their owners the inconvenience of having to use a basement car-park. An additional 69 car parking spaces will be provided in the basement car park for the rest of the development&rsquo;s car owners.
The Elephant with its numerous public transport connections was supposed to be a car-parking free zone and a carbon positive development. Despite this the first detailed application fails to conform with Southwark&rsquo;s requirement for zero car-parking and minimum 20% on-site renewable energy provision.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The 35% Campaign will be giving evidence this week at the 5-day Tribunal hearing for <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/southwark-in-tribunal-fight-to-keep-15bn-heygate-estate-deal-secret-8808759.html">Southwark Council&rsquo;s Appeal</a> against the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s ruling to disclose the Heygate financial viability figures.</p>

<p>We will be supporting the <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2013/07/24/heygate-figures-must-b-be-revealed-information-commissioner">Information Commissioner&rsquo;s decision</a> and giving evidence to show why we think it is important that the figures be disclosed. We will be showing the Tribunal evidence of the original regeneration benefits proposed, and how these have been squeezed or shelved as a result of the confidential viability assessement submitted as part of the Heygate masterplan application.</p>

<p>Examples include the excessive density of the development and the squeezing of London&rsquo;s newest park down to a <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2012/07/04/londons-largest-new-private-park-in-70-years">privately managed landscaped strip</a> overshadowed by 12 storey blocks:<br/>
<a href="/images/MasterplanComparison.jpg"><img src="/images/MasterplanComparison.jpg"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.bdunlop.com/images/Elephant-and-Castle/energy_envrnmtl-services_lge.gif"><img class="right" src="http://www.bdunlop.com/images/Elephant-and-Castle/energy_envrnmtl-services_lge.gif" width="400" height="300"></a> We will be explaining how the green credentials of the scheme have been further compromised by the shelving of the <a href="/images/MasterplanObjectives2010.pdf">proposed MUSCo</a> 100% on-site renewable energy facility, which has been <a href="/blog/2013/10/11/lean/">dropped</a> by Lend Lease in favour of a less costly <a href="http://www.35percent.org/sustainable-development">gas-fired boiler</a>.<br/>
</br></p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.bikehugger.com/images/blog/car_free_suburb.jpg" width="250" height="175">On the back of its viability poverty plea, Lend Lease also managed to secure permission for 616 new parking plots in what was supposed to be a car-free development.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br></p>

<p>More importantly we will be showing how the viability assessment justified reducing affordable housing from 35% to 25%, and was used to substitute so-called &lsquo;affordable rent&rsquo; (at around 50% market) for <a href="/images/se17rents.png">much cheaper</a> social rented tenure. We will also be pointing out how this contradicts Southwark&rsquo;s position in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-24002244">its fight</a> with Boris Johnson against the introduction of affordable rent in the Borough as a whole.</p>

<p>We plan to refer the Tribunal to viability assessments commisioned by the Council, which support the basis of its 35% affordable housing policy at the Elephant<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, and we will be asking Lend Lease why its viability assessment generated such significantly different results.</p>

<p>Finally, we will be pointing out to the Tribunal that the lack of an effective review mechanism for the viability assessment means that any improvement in viability over the scheme&rsquo;s 13 year development period, will end up as higher profits for Lend Lease rather than an increase in the affordable housing that the scheme was supposed to deliver.</p>

<p>Lend Lease claims that the public interest is best served by keeping the viability assessment secret. The information Commissioner believes - and we support him - that the public interest is much served by disclosing the document and opening it up to public scrutiny and debate.</p>

<h2>Apathetic Appellant?</h2>


<p>A <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s42747/Members%20Questions%20Report%20with%20responses.pdf">written question</a> to the Council Leader on how much the Council is spending on the appeal brought the following response in November last year:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The total estimated cost for the appeal is £57,920 plus VAT, of which about £40,250 will be funded by Lend Lease.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Cllr Peter John</strong> <cite>Council Leader - 27th Nov 2013</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>It seems clear to us who is driving this appeal - we think that even the modest amount spent on it by Southwark would be much better spent elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Tribunal hearing is open to the public and will be held at the <a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Competition+Appeals+Tribunal,+Victoria+House,+Bloomsbury+Place,+WC1A+2EB&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=51.48931,-0.08819&amp;sspn=0.668689,1.234589&amp;hq=Competition+Appeals+Tribunal,+Victoria+House,&amp;hnear=Bloomsbury+Pl,+London+WC1A,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">Competition Appeals Tribunal, Victoria House, Bloomsbury Place WC1A 2EB</a> - Monday 3rd through to Friday 7th February, 10:00am - 4:30pm.</p>

<p>Coincidentally the planning application for the first detailed phase of the Heygate masterplan development is being <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=119&amp;MId=4639&amp;Ver=4">heard on Tuesday</a> evening. This is for the so-called MP1 development bordering Wansey St for 360 new homes, of which 76 are &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; homes (55 shared ownership, 17 social rented and 4 affordable rent). The hearing will take place at 6.30pm on Tuesday at Southwark&rsquo;s Tooley street HQ.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/leisurecentreaerial.jpg" width="400" height="300"><a href="/images/OneTheElephantRegisterTGL381808.pdf">Land Registry documents</a> reveal that Southwark Council sold 1.4 acres of the old leisure centre site to developer <em>Lend Lease</em> for the bargain price of £6.5m. The site will now be home to <a href="http://www.onetheelephant.com">&lsquo;One the Elephant&rsquo;</a> - a 37 storey tower with 4 storey pavillion. <em>Lend Lease</em> also recently acquired the 23-acre Heygate estate site for a <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/elephant-and-castle-estate-revamp-ripped-off-taxpayers-8482794.html">generous £50m</a>.  </br></br></p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/onetheelephant.jpg" width="400" height="400">By way of comparison, the neighbouring and smaller site (1.2acres) of the former London Park Hotel was bought by a government agency <a href="/images/360TowerLandRegistry.pdf">for £17.7m in 2004</a>. New shopping centre owners <em>Delancey</em> <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/OakmayneLandRegistry.pdf">had to pay £40m</a> for another neighbouring site (Tribeca Square - 1.5 acres) to property developer <em>Eadon Ltd</em>, who thereby made a handsome profit having <a href="/images/TribecaLR.pdf">bought the land for just £18m</a> from the council in March 2007.

Instead Lend Lease proposed a payment of £3.5m towards the £25m cost of the new (pint-size) leisure centre. This payment is a fraction of Southwark&rsquo;s <a href="/images/affordablehousingspg.pdf">affordable housing policy tariff</a>, which should have netted it £33.2m. On the other hand <a href="http://lendlease2013.reportonline.com.au/annual-report/europe">61% of Lend Lease&rsquo;s new homes at the Elephant have been pre-sold off plan</a> to overseas buyers. <a href="/images/OneTheElephantRegisterTGL381808.pdf">The Land Registry documents</a> also reveal that 10 of the new flats at &lsquo;One the Elephant&rsquo; had even been sold before the land sale had even been processed. Of the 10 new owners registered 6 come from overseas: - 4 from Singapore; 1 from British Virgin Islands; 1 from Hong Kong; and the remaining 4 were snapped up by UK-based property investment companies.</p>

<p>The buoyant sales are undoubtedly due in part to <a href="http://www.onetheelephant.com/facilities/leisure-centre">Lend Lease&rsquo;s sales pitch</a> that new homes would have a brand new leisure centre on their doorstep.</p>

<p>Once completed, Lend Lease&rsquo;s &lsquo;One the Elephant&rsquo; development is expected to be worth around £200m<a href="#footnote-1">[1].</p>

<p>The revelation comes <a href="/images/SNleisurecentre.pdf">amidst separate news</a> that council chiefs had ignored the results of a public poll created in order to name the new leisure centre, in favour of a suggestion put forward by Lend Lease.</p>

<p>In October 2012, government body <em>Sport for England</em> <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6367">criticised the council&rsquo;s plans</a> to reduce the size of sports facilities at the leisure centre site.</p>

<p></br></p>

<h4>Pleading Poverty - Viability Assessments</h4>


<p>The deal that allows Lend Lease to maximise its profits by selling abroad and minimise its costs by cutting affordable housing, is justified by a <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2013/07/30/how-to-avoid-providing-affordable-housing-a-guide-for-developers">notorious viability assessment</a>. A similar assessment was <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2012/07/03/its-all-about-financial-viability">used for the Heygate</a> planning application, and in July 2013 the <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2013/07/24/heygate-figures-must-b-be-revealed-information-commissioner">Information Commissioner ruled</a> that it is heavily in the public interest that the public should get the chance to see the facts and figures behind Lend Lease&rsquo;s claim that they could not afford all the Heygate&rsquo;s affordable housing. The Tribunal hearing is due to take place on 3rd to 7th February.</p>

<p>Joining <em>Lend Lease</em> and Southwark in the noble cause of defending the developer&rsquo;s rights to know everything and tell the public next to nothing, are Boris Johnson&rsquo;s Greater London Authority and one of the world&rsquo;s largest real estate firms <em>Savills</em>. Amongst the <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2013/09/25/lend-lease-is-not-human/">arguments being put forward</a> by Lend Lease is that disclosure would be a breach of its human rights under article 1 of the Human Rights Act.</p>

<p>Council leader Peter John gave his reasons for resisting the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s decision in a <a href="/images/TranscriptOverviewScrutiny.pdf">statement</a> during a recent council meeting. He conceded that revealing the figures might not have any adverse impact on Southwark housing developments at all, but he is worried about the impact it could have on property developers elsewhere in the country, who may decide that it is better not to build unless they can keep their finances secret.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t think that Cllr John should worry too much about property developers - they are well able to look after themselves and when it suits them they are also happy enough to reveal viability assessments. The assessments for all of the following developments were revealed at planning appeal stage and nonetheless proceeded merrily:</p>

<pre><code>*Albert Embankment Development
*Doon Street Development
*Bondway and the Vauxhall Island Development
*Poplar Business Park Development
*King's Cross Regeneration Development
*Walthamstow Stadium Development 
</code></pre>

<p>It should be noted that most of these developments didn&rsquo;t entail the huge transfer of public land that the Heygate development requires. So the case for revealing the facts and the figures that allowed this to happen - without getting the affordable housing in return - is that much stronger, and as the Information Commissioner said in his report: disclosure is <strong> <em>&ldquo;heavily in the public interest&rdquo;</em> </strong>.</p>

<p><font size="1"><p id="footnote-1">[1] This is based on an expected average sales value of £700 per sq foot (269,000sq ft total = £188m). The Strata <a href="http://www.24dash.com/news/housing/2010-10-14-strata-inside-the-marmite-tower">achieved £615 per sq foot</a> on average. Plus 13,000 sq ft of retail in One the Elephant&rsquo;s pavilion = approx value between £5-10m) </p></font></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="http://cdn.ltstatic.com/2006/May/DK372644_942long.jpg" width="300" height="200">New owners of the shopping center <em>Delancey</em> is looking to build in excess of 1,000 new homes on the recently acquired site, <a href="http://www.costar.co.uk/en/assets/news/2013/December/CoStar-Column-Delancey-and-APGs-Elephant-move-marks-milestone-for-PRS/">according to the man</a> who arranged the partnership between <em>Delancey</em> and its financial backer <em>APG</em> - Chris Lacey of <a href="http://www.cbre.co.uk/uk-en">CBRE</a>.</p>

<p>One reason for the breach between the previous owners of the shopping centre (St. Modwen) and Southwark Council, was the amount of housing proposed for the 3.5 acre site. According to news reports St Modwen wanted at least 1,000 new homes, but Southwark <a href="http://www.costar.co.uk/en/assets/news/2013/March/Elephant--Castle-mall-sale-hits-housing-hitch/">drew the line at 500</a> and it is easy to see why: the Heygate estate had 1,200 homes and was 7 times the size of the shopping centre site.</p>

<p>According to Mr Lacey, Delancey will also propose a new American style &lsquo;build to rent&rsquo; development. Under this model the properties are not built for sale, but are private sector rented. The 360 Tower development operates in this way and is much <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2013/08/10/towering-disgrace">admired by Mayor Boris Johnson</a> who sees the wholesale expansion of the so-called PRS (Private Rented Sector) as the solution to London&rsquo;s housing crisis. How this model would fit with the present requirement to provide 35% affordable housing - half of which should be social rented - remains to be seen.</p>

<h4>Eileen House - it&#8217;ll be all over by Christmas</h4>


<p><img class="left" src="http://s0.geograph.org.uk/geophotos/02/64/29/2642974_bdc315a3.jpg" width="300" height="200">The GLA hearing to determine the outcome of the Eileen House planning application is due to reconvene on 19 December. Mayor Johnson will have to make a decision either to approve or reject developer Oakmayne&rsquo;s plans for the 41-storey tower over the objections of neighbour&rsquo;s Ministry of Sound. This application is 5 years old and has been dominated by the argument about whether or not a future resident - of a block not yet built - may complain often and loudly enough to jeopardise the Ministry of Sound&rsquo;s music licence. The hearing of 19 Nov had high-powered representatives including QCs arguing their respective cases. Council leader Peter John also appeared and argued in support of the application, despite it having been rejected by Southwark&rsquo;s own planning committee back in 2008. The fact that there is no social rented housing and very little affordable housing did not figure in the debate at all.</p>

<h4>Heygate Pyramid - monumental row brewing</h4>


<p><img class="left" src="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/pyramid-container.jpg" width="150" height="300"> It is fair to say that the <a href="/blog/2013/11/15/heygate-pyramid-proposed-pharaoh-not-included/">Heygate pyramid</a> has not yet got many friends. A <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/12/heygate-pyramid-london-estate-evicted-condemn-artwork?CMP=twt_gu">Guardian article</a> features quotes from a bemused former resident and a <a href="http://southwarknotes.wordpress.com/2013/12/13/heygate-estate-artangel-mike-nelson-pyramid-no-thanks/">local campaign</a> against the pyramid is now underway. Artangel trust who are behind the pyramid, have not done themselves any favours by not talking or explaining what it is they are about with local residents (despite their claims to the contrary). No date has yet been set for the planning committee hearing.<br/>

<h4>Huntsman & Hounds - pub saved</h4>


<p><img class="left" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Huntsman_and_Hounds,_Walworth,_SE17_(4485879963).jpg" width="250" height="200">The application to redevelop the Huntsman &amp; Hounds pub was approved last Tuesday. Eight flats will be built on the back on the pub, but the good news is that the pub is saved - albeit at half its current size; it will retain its facade. This was down to a great campaign by the pub regulars and other local residents led by the <a href="http://walworthsociety.co.uk/">Walworth Society</a>. They managed to get the pub listed as a community asset and a bid for the pub has been made by charity <a href="http://www.ustsc.org.uk/">United St. Saviours</a>; this however is unlikely to be successful.</p>

<p>The planning committee showed itself fully aware of the threat to the pub&rsquo;s long term viability, and pressed the developer for assurances of his intentions for keeping the pub - which he duly gave. One safeguard against a future conversion of the pub into more flats is that this would trigger the requirement to provide either affordable housing or an in-lieu payment. Our fingers are crossed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/lbskleptocracy.png" width="380" height="285">
There was much surprise at Southwark&rsquo;s <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=308&amp;MId=4593&amp;Ver=4">Overview and Scrutiny Meeting</a> last Monday, when new shopping centre owner <em><a href="http://www.delancey.com/about.html">&lsquo;Delancey&rsquo;</a></em> turned up accompanied by Southwark Council&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kim-humphreys/5/312/a34">former deputy leader and head of housing</a> Kim Humphreys. Kim is now <em><a href="http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/">&lsquo;Carvil Ventures&rsquo;</a></em> - an independent corporate finance and real-estate consultancy and is advising global property developer Delancey. He is not the first former senior councillor to take this road: former council leader Jeremy Fraser <a href="http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,10971,440,00.htm">founded</a> PR consultancy <em><a href="http://www.fourcommunications.com/">&lsquo;Four Communications&rsquo;</a></em> after leaving the council, which advised developer Oakmayne and prepared <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/42382_1.pdf">part of the planning application for its Eileen House development</a>.</p>

<p>Southwark residents are understandably confused when it sees former senior councillors who were intimately involved in drafting and implementing regeneration plans, turning up later in their careers working for the developers who are set to profit from said regeneration.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/uploads/Kim-humphreys-203x152.jpg">It might be hoped that the involvement of former councillors in the practical delivery of the regeneration would help guarantee the delivery of the long-promised public benefit, e.g affordable housing. Experience so far proves otherwise: Kim Humphries was in charge when the infamous <a href="http://youtu.be/E9-cfAdGiFA">&lsquo;Heygate Action Plan&rsquo;</a> decanted 1,000 households without first building anywhere for them to go back in 2007. It may be that as Delancey&rsquo;s new consigliere Kim will redeem himself by ensuring that any housing Delancey provides will include the requisite 35% affordable quota, the omens aren&rsquo;t good however: there were hints that Delancey would be seeking to argue for an exemption to the quota; and its neighbouring <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7208">&lsquo;Tribeca Square&rsquo; development</a> has no affordable housing of any kind.</p>

<p><a href="/images/affordablehousingspg.pdf"><img class="left" src="/images/affordablehousingspg.png" width="300" height="400"></a>Delancey has made an in-lieu payment of £1m to Southwark for off-site affordable housing provision in relation to its Tribeca Square development, but this is a fraction of the £52m that should have been paid had <a href="/images/affordablehousingspg.pdf">Southwark&rsquo;s tariff</a> for in-lieu payments been adhered to - £100,000 per room x 527 habitable rooms (35% of Tribeca Square total). As with the Heygate outline masterplan, a viability assessment again worked its magic for the developer, by demonstrating that the development could not afford to provide affordable housing and an acceptable 20% profit margin. The application was accepted by the planning committee despite the reservations of both council officer&rsquo;s and the Greater London Authority about the accuracy of the viability appraisal:
<img src="/images/gla.jpg"></p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/1311085254_80.177.117.97.jpg">Alongside the Heygate estate, the shopping centre site has always been the key development for the Elephant regeneration. It was not only going to provide the retail offer, it was also going to provide a civic space similar in size to Trafalgar Square that was to attract new people with more money to the Elephant; as such it is a key driver of the gentrification the regeneration entails.</p>

<p>It was <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7238">confirmed</a> that the sale price of the 3.5 acre shopping centre site was £80m, and that buyer Delancey had teamed up for the joint-venture purchase with pension fund <a href="http://www.apg.nl/apgsite/pages/english/services/asset-management/responsible-investing/real-estate.asp">APG</a> - one of the worlds&#8217; largest investors in real-estate.</p>

<p>Other <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7258">reports</a> of the sale outlined concerns from the shopping centre&rsquo;s existing retailers that they would be pushed out by the redevelopment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/pjtutankhaman.jpg" width="300" height="310">The Heygate is to get a pyramid.  Turner Prize nominee Mike Nelson and public arts organisation <a href="http://www.artangel.org.uk/">Artangel Trust</a>  would like to reconfigure one of the Heygate’s maisonette blocks to build a giant square pyramid, not far from where the last Heygate resident was <a href="/blog/2013/11/06/southwark-sends-in-the-heavy-mob/">evicted last week</a>.  Artangel organised <a href="http://www.artangel.org.uk/projects/2008/seizure">‘Seizure’</a>, the blue crystal-filled council flat, also at the Elephant a couple of years ago.  Artist Mike was described ‘as the next big thing’ by the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/sep/04/artsfeatures.turnerprize2001">Guardian in 2001</a>, and in the spirit of artistic intervention we have here our own image of how Southwark Council leader Peter John might look in his new role.</p>

<p>Local speculation is that this masterwork is being paid for by Lend Lease. The planning application for the pyramid can be found through <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeResultDetail&amp;TheSystemkey=9552014">this link</a>; click on ‘documents’- the deadline for comments is 21 Nov. Below is an extract from <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/328350_1.pdf">one of the planning application&rsquo;s documents</a>, which shows how the remnants of Heygate residents&#8217; former homes are to be used in this imaginative reconstruction.</p>

<h3>Eileen House – latest latest</h3>


<p>The public hearing to determine the Eileen House planning application is now set for 19 Nov at City Hall.  This is exactly two years and one day after the application was refused by Southwark Council, for amongst other things, a lack of affordable housing.</p>

<h3>Heygate MP1 has landed</h3>


<p>The next detailed applications for the Heygate have now been submitted. Links to three of the applications are below, for the 360 homes to be built on what is now known as phase MP1 running alongside Wansey street and Brandon street. We will be examining these in future posts. For the moment a quick look at the Energy Statement in 13/AP/3581 tells us that <strong> <em>&ldquo;11.1.7 The Development does not comply with the aspiration for 20% carbon reduction by renewable energy set out in Strategic Policy 13&rdquo;</em> </strong> which requires a minimum 20% on-site renewable energy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The last resident of the Heygate estate was forcibly evicted from his home today. A team of bailiffs from <a href="https://www.shergroup.net">Shergroup Ltd</a> accompanied by police and officers from Southwark Council arrived at lunchtime, and after a short conversation the last resident left - with the help of the bailiffs. No notice of the impending eviction was issued to him, his surveyor or solicitor.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.shergroup.net/images/about.jpg"></p>

<p>Adrian Glasspol&rsquo;s home <a href="/blog/2013/10/27/the-end-for-the-last-heygate-residents/">passed into Southwark&rsquo;s ownership</a> on Monday. On the same day Adrian, his surveyor and Southwark&rsquo;s surveyor met to make a final valuation of the property. Southwark&rsquo;s surveyor formally asked Adrian to leave that day. Adrian said that he would leave as soon as he received a call from his solicitor telling him that his compensation payment had been paid into his solicitor&rsquo;s holding account.</p>

<p>Southwark made no payment and instead today it went ahead with a forced eviction. This evening it informed Adrian&rsquo;s surveyor that payment will be made - after his eviction and less its £6,888 cost.
</br></p>

<h4>Brute force and ignorance</h4>


<p>Why did Southwark Council resort to physical force to remove Adrian? It clearly had the paperwork all ready to go, and was willing to authorise payment - <strong>after</strong> his eviction.</p>

<p>Southwark has behaved vindictively: Adrian and other leaseholders have fought long and hard to get a just amount for their homes. Homes they did not want to leave in an area where they can now no longer live. Unfortunately their battle was without success, but it was too much for Southwark who had to explain themselves at length at the <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2013/07/18/regeneration-branded-miserable-failure-at-cpo-public-inquiry/">CPO public inquiry in Feb 2013</a>, when amongst many other embarrassing facts it was revealed that only 45 Heygate residents have been rehoused in new homes at the Elephant.</p>

<h4>Leaseholders beware</h4>


<p>This must also be an alarming event for any leaseholder in Southwark who lies in the path of a regeneration scheme - and there are many, including 580 <a href="/images/SNWolvertonLeaseholders.pdf">on the Aylesbury estate</a> just down the road from the Heygate. Southwark Council have shown that they are not willing to either negotiate or compromise but will instead resort to the harshest methods to get their own way.</p>

<p>Southwark has <a href="http://heygate.github.io/displacement.html">broken every promise</a> ever made to the residents of the Heygate whether they were leaseholders or tenants, and it seems fitting that the very last of the 3,000 forced out since 2007 should require the assistance of bailiffs. It is entirely consistent with the shabby treatment residents have received right from the beginning of this whole sorry excuse for a regeneration scheme.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Southwark Council stole our homes and we are not going to forget it.</p><footer><strong>Terry Redpath</strong> <cite>Former Heygate Leaseholder</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p><img class="left" src="/images/LendLeaseStoleMyHome.jpg" width="259" height="387">The final two Heygate residents must leave the estate by 4th Nov. These will be the last of the 990 households still resident on the Heygate when the <a href="http://heygate.github.io/displacement.html">notorious Heygate Action Plan</a> was put into effect in 2007. This plan decreed that everybody would be moved off the estate before the new homes they were promised would rehouse them were built.</p>

<p>The final residents <a href="/images/LBS3Oct2013.pdf">have been told</a> that if they are not gone by 4th Nov the bailiffs will be knocking at their doors. They are in a quandary however: The compensation they need to buy a new home will not be paid until after they have left.</p>

<p>A request to Southwark Council that the compensation be paid before they leave - which only seems reasonable - has been refused. On top of this, Southwark has threatened to reduce the compensation by the amount required to pay any bailiffs and associated legal costs.</p>

<p>In response to an enquiry as to what housing might be available should leaseholders have nowhere to go, Southwark first referred them to its emergency housing services, who then said that it had no legal obligation to provide temporary accommodation and suggested staying with friends and family.</p>

<p><a href="http://heygate.github.io/displacement.html"><img class="left" src="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/newhomesforheygate.jpg" width="300" height="350"></a>This is a very long way from <strong>&lsquo;NEW HOMES FOR HEYGATE&rsquo;</strong> where every resident on the estate - whether tenant or leaseholder - was promised a new home in one of 16 replacement housing sites.</p>

<p>It is worth remembering what was promised:</p>

<p><a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/Appendix8.pdf"><img src="http://heygate.github.io/img/HeygateNews.jpg" width="300" height="200" align="right" style="margin: 10px; float: right"></a></p>

<p>Leaseholders were <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/HeygateLeaseholderPolicy2005.pdf">originally offered</a> a <a href="/images/HeygateLeaseholderToolkit.pdf">shared equity option</a> on buying a new home in one of <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/new_homes_for_heygate.pdf">16 replacement housing sites</a> and the new-build Heygate homes<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. But despite reaching the point of being <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/ChooseYourNewHome.pdf">asked to choose</a> what kind of layout they preferred for their new homes, the shared equity option never got written into the final agreements with the developers of the sites, and no leaseholders were able to move into any of the replacement housing sites or the new Heygate homes. </br>When asked at the recent CPO public inquiry why leaseholders didn&rsquo;t get the new homes that they had been promised, the council&rsquo;s lead officer replied <b><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I wasn&rsquo;t employed by the council at the time the promises were made. But the new homes will be open for anybody to purchase and I am sure Lend Lease will be happy to sell to anybody.&rdquo;</b></i>:</p>

<iframe width="300" height="225" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bLIg4xGZrPI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Most leaseholders have subsequently been forced to relocate to outer London boroughs because of the low valuations offered in compensation for their homes. Any leaseholder wanting to return to the Heygate will have to compete with overseas buyers at market prices well beyond their means. New-build Heyate homes are currently being sold at prices starting from <a href="http://trafalgarplace.com">£340,000</a> for a 1-bed flat, and are being heavily marketed overseas in <a href="http://www2.hkej.com/property/article/id/77797">China</a>, <a href="http://www.65house.com/news/20130412/2638.html">Singapore</a>, <a href="http://www.theborneopost.com/2013/04/24/lend-lease-launches-trafalgar-place-development-in-london/">Malaysia</a> and <a href="http://colliersip.com/uk/trafalgar-place-london/">Hong Kong</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/TrafalgarPlaceCN.png"></p>

<p><a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/LBSHeygateacquisitionsOct2012.xls">Analysis of information received from FOI requests</a> shows that the average compensation received by leaseholders as the council&rsquo;s valuation of their homes is as follows:</p>
<b></p>

<ul>
<li>1 Bed flat - £95,480</li>
<li>2 Bed flat - £107,230</li>
<li>3 Bed Maisonette - £156,833</li>
<li>4 Bed Maisonette - £177,421</li>
</ul>


<p></b></p>

<p>This is why most have been forced to <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2013/06/08/the-heygate-diaspora">relocate outside central London</a>.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://heygate.github.io/img/TerryRedpath.jpg" width="300" height="200">In a recent interview with Property Week magazine</a>, former Heygate leaseholder Terry Redpath said <strong> <em>&ldquo;We could no longer afford to stay in the area: the compensation we received plus £45,000 of life savings bought us a terraced property 15 miles out of London. I feel that we have been forced to give up our home to accommodate the building of homes for overseas investors.”</em> </strong>
</br></p>

<p>Redpath is a former Southwark housing officer who lived on the estate for 35 years, and whose family has lived in the area for generations. On average the compensation paid to leaseholders amounts to around a quarter of the price of the new Heygate homes</a>.</p>

<p>When Southwark Council took the decision to push residents off the estate in 2007, it wasn&rsquo;t just bad news for Heygate residents, it was the first step towards putting any new Heygate homes beyond the reach of most people in London.</p>

New-build Heyate homes are currently being sold at prices starting from <a href="http://trafalgarplace.com">£340,000</a> for a 1-bed flat, and are being heavily marketed overseas in <a href="http://www2.hkej.com/property/article/id/77797">China</a>, <a href="http://www.65house.com/news/20130412/2638.html">Singapore</a>, <a href="http://www.theborneopost.com/2013/04/24/lend-lease-launches-trafalgar-place-development-in-london/">Malaysia</a>, <a href="http://property.hk.msn.com/news/new-development-tc/ad-15774/">Hong Kong</a>. <a href="img/LBSHeygateacquisitionsOct2012.xls">Analysis of information received from FOI requests</a> shows that the average compensation received by leaseholders for their homes is as follows:</p>
<b></p>

<ul>
<li>1 Bed flat - £95,480</li>
<li>2 Bed flat - £107,230</li>
<li>3 Bed Maisonette - £156,833</li>
<li>4 Bed Maisonette - £177,421</li>
</ul>


<p></b></p>

<p>This is why most have been forced to <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2013/06/08/the-heygate-diaspora">relocate outside central London</a>.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://heygate.github.io/img/TerryRedpath.jpg" width="300" height="200">In a recent <a href="http://t.co/m4JMqGdwsZ">interview with Property Week magazine</a>, former Heygate leaseholder Terry Redpath said <i><b>&ldquo;We could no longer afford to stay in the area: the compensation we received plus £45,000 of life savings bought us a terraced property 15 miles out of London. I feel that we have been forced to give up our home to accommodate the building of homes for overseas investors.”</i></b>
</br></p>

<p>Redpath is a former Southwark housing officer who lived on the estate for 35 years, and whose family has lived in the area for generations. On average the compensation paid to leaseholders amounts to around a quarter of the price of the <a href="http://trafalgarplace.com/?page_id=29">new Heygate homes</a>.</p>

<p>When Southwark Council took the decision to push residents off the estate in 2007, it wasn&rsquo;t just bad news for Heygate residents, it was the first step towards putting any new Heygate homes beyond the reach of most people in London.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/eileen-housenew.jpg" width="320" height="320">The decision on the <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeDocs&amp;TheSystemkey=9531326">Eileen House planning application</a>, 335 flats, 41 stories  has been delayed once more.  The public hearing that was to be held 24 Oct at City Hall has been postponed for ‘procedural reasons’.  Previous hearings in March and February were also cancelled.
While Southwark’s housing waiting list accelerates upwards, developers Oakmayne and the Ministry of Sound have battled over the fate of this key development site.  The application was submitted in 2009 and rejected by Southwark in 2011.  The power of decision was then taken over by Boris Johnson, who has been reviewing it ever since.</p>

<p>One of Southwark’s grounds for rejecting the application was that it has no social rented housing, but this wasn’t an obstacle for the Elephant’s other ‘Towers of Shame’ – Strata Tower, One the Elephant, St Mary’s residential, Tribeca Square– which don’t have a single social rented unit amongst their 1500 homes.  The real obstacle has been determined objections from Ministry Of Sound, which fears future complaints from their new neighbours.
MoS’s concerns are no doubt well founded and young people have a legitimate need to dance themselves silly, but in a sensible world this would be trumped by the need of others for somewhere to live – not that this need will be properly met by another social housing-free development.</p>

<p>For its part Oakmayne  should be told – no social housing means no planning approval, but the chances of Mayor Johnson taking this view are non-existent.
MoS and Oakmayne pay lip-service to the aims of the regeneration but define it entirely in their own self-interested terms; local people (and Southwark Council) have been reduced to bystanders.</p>

<p><strong>N.B.:</strong>Oakmayne, like <a href="/images/StrataLRTitle.pdf">Strata Tower developers</a> are registered as an offshore company on the Isle of Man and therefore pay no UK tax. This setup also <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/16/london-property-tax-avoidance-offshore">enables it</a> to legally sell its flats while avoiding the payment of stamp duty.</p>

<h2>SHOPPING CENTRE LATEST</h2>


<p><img class="left" src="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/1255443526_80.177.117.97.jpg" width="300" height="200">Battle lines are also being drawn over the road at the Elephant shopping centre.  Southwark Council leader Peter John <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7151">told the council assembly</a> that he expected shopping centre owners St Modwen to deliver a development plan by the end of the year. He ruled out refurbishment as an acceptable option. Previously head of regeneration Cllr Fiona Colley <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7077">had also said</a> the shopping centre would be demolished. St Modwen’s say very little, though there have been press reports that they might sell up, with Lendlease rumoured as purchasers.
One thing continues unchanged – shopkeepers and their customers have been left out of this conversation.
The shopping centre is much ridiculed, but an awful lot of people work, shop and socialise there and it is time they were brought into the arguments about its future.</p>

<h2>BOX PARK MARK II</h2>


<p><img class="left" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ujXl9dbqKE8/UYfaKxGkomI/AAAAAAAABDE/FC250zOeDRU/s1600/IMG_3352.JPG" width="300" height="200">The consultation period for the second planning application for the <a href="/blog/2013/06/22/a-little-bit-of-shoreditch/">Box Park</a> has just ended, although comments will still be received by Southwark planning.  The park has grown in size to 56 units (each a shipping container) and been moved down the road from the Shell garage to the corner of Walworth Rd and Elephant Rd, formerly Elephant Park.
<img class="right" src="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/elephant-rd.jpg" width="300" height="200">Many remember that the London Latin American community used to have a <a href="http://www.thefirstpint.co.uk/2011/04/16/londons-heygate-estate-the-end-of-utopia/">football league here</a>, before the Park had to be <a href="https://elephantamenity.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/no-more-football-on-the-elephant-park/">given up</a> to the <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3641">Tribeca Square development</a>; developers Delancey say they can manage without it after all, so it now looks like a needless sacrifice.
This aside, nearby Wansey St residents welcome the move of the Box Park away from their immediate vicinity.<br/>
Other changes include the name (it is now known as The Artworks), dropping the live/work element of the proposal, which was met with scepticism from the many artists and artisans in the area, and the inclusion of a marketing suite for Lendlease, developers of the Heygate estate.  Otherwise the application proposes a similiar mix of  uses – retail, café, restaurant, indoor market, business workspace, gallery, community space – although the extent of each is not specified.
It will be a temporary development for five years and the applicants are asking that the usual s106 contributions (for mitigating the impact of developments) be waived in this instance, partly because of its temporary nature, partly because the s106 benefits are supposedly included in the application already.
Curiously, Artworks has not withdrawn the previous application for the Shell garage site, saying simply that it has <strong> <em>‘..yet to be determined by the Council’.</em> </strong>  The new application’s reference  number is 13/AP/2927; planning documents can be found <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeDocs&amp;TheSystemkey=9551217">here.</a></p>
