There was much surprise at Southwark&rsquo;s <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=308&amp;MId=4593&amp;Ver=4">Overview and Scrutiny Meeting</a> last Monday, when new shopping centre owner <em><a href="http://www.delancey.com/about.html">&lsquo;Delancey&rsquo;</a></em> turned up accompanied by Southwark Council&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kim-humphreys/5/312/a34">former deputy leader and head of housing</a> Kim Humphreys. Kim is now <em><a href="http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/">&lsquo;Carvil Ventures&rsquo;</a></em> - an independent corporate finance and real-estate consultancy and is advising global property developer Delancey. He is not the first former senior councillor to take this road: former council leader Jeremy Fraser <a href="http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,10971,440,00.htm">founded</a> PR consultancy <em><a href="http://www.fourcommunications.com/">&lsquo;Four Communications&rsquo;</a></em> after leaving the council, which advised developer Oakmayne and prepared <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/42382_1.pdf">part of the planning application for its Eileen House development</a>.</p>

<p>Southwark residents are understandably confused when it sees former senior councillors who were intimately involved in drafting and implementing regeneration plans, turning up later in their careers working for the developers who are set to profit from said regeneration.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/uploads/Kim-humphreys-203x152.jpg">It might be hoped that the involvement of former councillors in the practical delivery of the regeneration would help guarantee the delivery of the long-promised public benefit, e.g affordable housing. Experience so far proves otherwise: Kim Humphries was in charge when the infamous <a href="http://youtu.be/E9-cfAdGiFA">&lsquo;Heygate Action Plan&rsquo;</a> decanted 1,000 households without first building anywhere for them to go back in 2007. It may be that as Delancey&rsquo;s new consigliere Kim will redeem himself by ensuring that any housing Delancey provides will include the requisite 35% affordable quota, the omens aren&rsquo;t good however: there were hints that Delancey would be seeking to argue for an exemption to the quota; and its neighbouring <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7208">&lsquo;Tribeca Square&rsquo; development</a> has no affordable housing of any kind.</p>

<p><a href="/images/affordablehousingspg.pdf"><img class="left" src="/images/affordablehousingspg.png" width="300" height="400"></a>Delancey has made an in-lieu payment of £1m to Southwark for off-site affordable housing provision in relation to its Tribeca Square development, but this is a fraction of the £52m that should have been paid had <a href="/images/affordablehousingspg.pdf">Southwark&rsquo;s tariff</a> for in-lieu payments been adhered to - £100,000 per room x 527 habitable rooms (35% of Tribeca Square total). As with the Heygate outline masterplan, a viability assessment again worked its magic for the developer, by demonstrating that the development could not afford to provide affordable housing and an acceptable 20% profit margin. The application was accepted by the planning committee despite the reservations of both council officer&rsquo;s and the Greater London Authority about the accuracy of the viability appraisal:
<img src="/images/gla.jpg"></p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/1311085254_80.177.117.97.jpg">Alongside the Heygate estate, the shopping centre site has always been the key development for the Elephant regeneration. It was not only going to provide the retail offer, it was also going to provide a civic space similar in size to Trafalgar Square that was to attract new people with more money to the Elephant; as such it is a key driver of the gentrification the regeneration entails.</p>

<p>It was <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7238">confirmed</a> that the sale price of the 3.5 acre shopping centre site was £80m, and that buyer Delancey had teamed up for the joint-venture purchase with pension fund <a href="http://www.apg.nl/apgsite/pages/english/services/asset-management/responsible-investing/real-estate.asp">APG</a> - one of the worlds&#8217; largest investors in real-estate.</p>

<p>Other <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7258">reports</a> of the sale outlined concerns from the shopping centre&rsquo;s existing retailers that they would be pushed out by the redevelopment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/pjtutankhaman.jpg" width="300" height="310">The Heygate is to get a pyramid.  Turner Prize nominee Mike Nelson and public arts organisation <a href="http://www.artangel.org.uk/">Artangel Trust</a>  would like to reconfigure one of the Heygate’s maisonette blocks to build a giant square pyramid, not far from where the last Heygate resident was <a href="/blog/2013/11/06/southwark-sends-in-the-heavy-mob/">evicted last week</a>.  Artangel organised <a href="http://www.artangel.org.uk/projects/2008/seizure">‘Seizure’</a>, the blue crystal-filled council flat, also at the Elephant a couple of years ago.  Artist Mike was described ‘as the next big thing’ by the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/sep/04/artsfeatures.turnerprize2001">Guardian in 2001</a>, and in the spirit of artistic intervention we have here our own image of how Southwark Council leader Peter John might look in his new role.</p>

<p>Local speculation is that this masterwork is being paid for by Lend Lease. The planning application for the pyramid can be found through <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeResultDetail&amp;TheSystemkey=9552014">this link</a>; click on ‘documents’- the deadline for comments is 21 Nov. Below is an extract from <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/328350_1.pdf">one of the planning application&rsquo;s documents</a>, which shows how the remnants of Heygate residents&#8217; former homes are to be used in this imaginative reconstruction.</p>

<h3>Eileen House – latest latest</h3>


<p>The public hearing to determine the Eileen House planning application is now set for 19 Nov at City Hall.  This is exactly two years and one day after the application was refused by Southwark Council, for amongst other things, a lack of affordable housing.</p>

<h3>Heygate MP1 has landed</h3>


<p>The next detailed applications for the Heygate have now been submitted. Links to three of the applications are below, for the 360 homes to be built on what is now known as phase MP1 running alongside Wansey street and Brandon street. We will be examining these in future posts. For the moment a quick look at the Energy Statement in 13/AP/3581 tells us that <strong> <em>&ldquo;11.1.7 The Development does not comply with the aspiration for 20% carbon reduction by renewable energy set out in Strategic Policy 13&rdquo;</em> </strong> which requires a minimum 20% on-site renewable energy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The last resident of the Heygate estate was forcibly evicted from his home today. A team of bailiffs from <a href="https://www.shergroup.net">Shergroup Ltd</a> accompanied by police and officers from Southwark Council arrived at lunchtime, and after a short conversation the last resident left - with the help of the bailiffs. No notice of the impending eviction was issued to him, his surveyor or solicitor.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.shergroup.net/images/about.jpg"></p>

<p>Adrian Glasspol&rsquo;s home <a href="/blog/2013/10/27/the-end-for-the-last-heygate-residents/">passed into Southwark&rsquo;s ownership</a> on Monday. On the same day Adrian, his surveyor and Southwark&rsquo;s surveyor met to make a final valuation of the property. Southwark&rsquo;s surveyor formally asked Adrian to leave that day. Adrian said that he would leave as soon as he received a call from his solicitor telling him that his compensation payment had been paid into his solicitor&rsquo;s holding account.</p>

<p>Southwark made no payment and instead today it went ahead with a forced eviction. This evening it informed Adrian&rsquo;s surveyor that payment will be made - after his eviction and less its £6,888 cost.
</br></p>

<h4>Brute force and ignorance</h4>


<p>Why did Southwark Council resort to physical force to remove Adrian? It clearly had the paperwork all ready to go, and was willing to authorise payment - <strong>after</strong> his eviction.</p>

<p>Southwark has behaved vindictively: Adrian and other leaseholders have fought long and hard to get a just amount for their homes. Homes they did not want to leave in an area where they can now no longer live. Unfortunately their battle was without success, but it was too much for Southwark who had to explain themselves at length at the <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2013/07/18/regeneration-branded-miserable-failure-at-cpo-public-inquiry/">CPO public inquiry in Feb 2013</a>, when amongst many other embarrassing facts it was revealed that only 45 Heygate residents have been rehoused in new homes at the Elephant.</p>

<h4>Leaseholders beware</h4>


<p>This must also be an alarming event for any leaseholder in Southwark who lies in the path of a regeneration scheme - and there are many, including 580 <a href="/images/SNWolvertonLeaseholders.pdf">on the Aylesbury estate</a> just down the road from the Heygate. Southwark Council have shown that they are not willing to either negotiate or compromise but will instead resort to the harshest methods to get their own way.</p>

<p>Southwark has <a href="http://heygate.github.io/displacement.html">broken every promise</a> ever made to the residents of the Heygate whether they were leaseholders or tenants, and it seems fitting that the very last of the 3,000 forced out since 2007 should require the assistance of bailiffs. It is entirely consistent with the shabby treatment residents have received right from the beginning of this whole sorry excuse for a regeneration scheme.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Southwark Council stole our homes and we are not going to forget it.</p><footer><strong>Terry Redpath</strong> <cite>Former Heygate Leaseholder</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p><img class="left" src="/images/LendLeaseStoleMyHome.jpg" width="259" height="387">The final two Heygate residents must leave the estate by 4th Nov. These will be the last of the 990 households still resident on the Heygate when the <a href="http://heygate.github.io/displacement.html">notorious Heygate Action Plan</a> was put into effect in 2007. This plan decreed that everybody would be moved off the estate before the new homes they were promised would rehouse them were built.</p>

<p>The final residents <a href="/images/LBS3Oct2013.pdf">have been told</a> that if they are not gone by 4th Nov the bailiffs will be knocking at their doors. They are in a quandary however: The compensation they need to buy a new home will not be paid until after they have left.</p>

<p>A request to Southwark Council that the compensation be paid before they leave - which only seems reasonable - has been refused. On top of this, Southwark has threatened to reduce the compensation by the amount required to pay any bailiffs and associated legal costs.</p>

<p>In response to an enquiry as to what housing might be available should leaseholders have nowhere to go, Southwark first referred them to its emergency housing services, who then said that it had no legal obligation to provide temporary accommodation and suggested staying with friends and family.</p>

<p><a href="http://heygate.github.io/displacement.html"><img class="left" src="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/newhomesforheygate.jpg" width="300" height="350"></a>This is a very long way from <strong>&lsquo;NEW HOMES FOR HEYGATE&rsquo;</strong> where every resident on the estate - whether tenant or leaseholder - was promised a new home in one of 16 replacement housing sites.</p>

<p>It is worth remembering what was promised:</p>

<p><a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/Appendix8.pdf"><img src="http://heygate.github.io/img/HeygateNews.jpg" width="300" height="200" align="right" style="margin: 10px; float: right"></a></p>

<p>Leaseholders were <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/HeygateLeaseholderPolicy2005.pdf">originally offered</a> a <a href="/images/HeygateLeaseholderToolkit.pdf">shared equity option</a> on buying a new home in one of <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/new_homes_for_heygate.pdf">16 replacement housing sites</a> and the new-build Heygate homes<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. But despite reaching the point of being <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/ChooseYourNewHome.pdf">asked to choose</a> what kind of layout they preferred for their new homes, the shared equity option never got written into the final agreements with the developers of the sites, and no leaseholders were able to move into any of the replacement housing sites or the new Heygate homes. </br>When asked at the recent CPO public inquiry why leaseholders didn&rsquo;t get the new homes that they had been promised, the council&rsquo;s lead officer replied <b><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I wasn&rsquo;t employed by the council at the time the promises were made. But the new homes will be open for anybody to purchase and I am sure Lend Lease will be happy to sell to anybody.&rdquo;</b></i>:</p>

<iframe width="300" height="225" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bLIg4xGZrPI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Most leaseholders have subsequently been forced to relocate to outer London boroughs because of the low valuations offered in compensation for their homes. Any leaseholder wanting to return to the Heygate will have to compete with overseas buyers at market prices well beyond their means. New-build Heyate homes are currently being sold at prices starting from <a href="http://trafalgarplace.com">£340,000</a> for a 1-bed flat, and are being heavily marketed overseas in <a href="http://www2.hkej.com/property/article/id/77797">China</a>, <a href="http://www.65house.com/news/20130412/2638.html">Singapore</a>, <a href="http://www.theborneopost.com/2013/04/24/lend-lease-launches-trafalgar-place-development-in-london/">Malaysia</a> and <a href="http://colliersip.com/uk/trafalgar-place-london/">Hong Kong</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/TrafalgarPlaceCN.png"></p>

<p><a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/LBSHeygateacquisitionsOct2012.xls">Analysis of information received from FOI requests</a> shows that the average compensation received by leaseholders as the council&rsquo;s valuation of their homes is as follows:</p>
<b></p>

<ul>
<li>1 Bed flat - £95,480</li>
<li>2 Bed flat - £107,230</li>
<li>3 Bed Maisonette - £156,833</li>
<li>4 Bed Maisonette - £177,421</li>
</ul>


<p></b></p>

<p>This is why most have been forced to <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2013/06/08/the-heygate-diaspora">relocate outside central London</a>.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://heygate.github.io/img/TerryRedpath.jpg" width="300" height="200">In a recent interview with Property Week magazine</a>, former Heygate leaseholder Terry Redpath said <strong> <em>&ldquo;We could no longer afford to stay in the area: the compensation we received plus £45,000 of life savings bought us a terraced property 15 miles out of London. I feel that we have been forced to give up our home to accommodate the building of homes for overseas investors.”</em> </strong>
</br></p>

<p>Redpath is a former Southwark housing officer who lived on the estate for 35 years, and whose family has lived in the area for generations. On average the compensation paid to leaseholders amounts to around a quarter of the price of the new Heygate homes</a>.</p>

<p>When Southwark Council took the decision to push residents off the estate in 2007, it wasn&rsquo;t just bad news for Heygate residents, it was the first step towards putting any new Heygate homes beyond the reach of most people in London.</p>

When asked at the recent CPO public inquiry why leaseholders didn&rsquo;t get the new homes that they had been promised, the Council&rsquo;s lead officer replied <b><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I wasn&rsquo;t employed by the council at the time the promises were made. But the new homes will be open for anybody to purchase and I am sure Lend Lease will be happy to sell to anybody.&rdquo;</b></i>: </br></p>

<p></br>
Most leaseholders have subsequently been forced to relocate outside central London because of the low valuations offered in compensation for their homes. Any leaseholder wanting to return to the Heygate will have to compete with overseas buyers at market prices well beyond their means. New-build Heyate homes are currently being sold at prices starting from <a href="http://trafalgarplace.com">£340,000</a> for a 1-bed flat, and are being heavily marketed overseas in <a href="http://www2.hkej.com/property/article/id/77797">China</a>, <a href="http://www.65house.com/news/20130412/2638.html">Singapore</a>, <a href="http://www.theborneopost.com/2013/04/24/lend-lease-launches-trafalgar-place-development-in-london/">Malaysia</a>, <a href="http://property.hk.msn.com/news/new-development-tc/ad-15774/">Hong Kong</a>. <a href="img/LBSHeygateacquisitionsOct2012.xls">Analysis of information received from FOI requests</a> shows that the average compensation received by leaseholders for their homes is as follows:</p>
<b></p>

<ul>
<li>1 Bed flat - £95,480</li>
<li>2 Bed flat - £107,230</li>
<li>3 Bed Maisonette - £156,833</li>
<li>4 Bed Maisonette - £177,421</li>
</ul>


<p></b></p>

<p>This is why most have been forced to <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2013/06/08/the-heygate-diaspora">relocate outside central London</a>.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://heygate.github.io/img/TerryRedpath.jpg" width="300" height="200">In a recent <a href="http://t.co/m4JMqGdwsZ">interview with Property Week magazine</a>, former Heygate leaseholder Terry Redpath said <i><b>&ldquo;We could no longer afford to stay in the area: the compensation we received plus £45,000 of life savings bought us a terraced property 15 miles out of London. I feel that we have been forced to give up our home to accommodate the building of homes for overseas investors.”</i></b>
</br></p>

<p>Redpath is a former Southwark housing officer who lived on the estate for 35 years, and whose family has lived in the area for generations. On average the compensation paid to leaseholders amounts to around a quarter of the price of the <a href="http://trafalgarplace.com/?page_id=29">new Heygate homes</a>.</p>

<p>When Southwark Council took the decision to push residents off the estate in 2007, it wasn&rsquo;t just bad news for Heygate residents, it was the first step towards putting any new Heygate homes beyond the reach of most people in London.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/eileen-housenew.jpg" width="320" height="320">The decision on the <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeDocs&amp;TheSystemkey=9531326">Eileen House planning application</a>, 335 flats, 41 stories  has been delayed once more.  The public hearing that was to be held 24 Oct at City Hall has been postponed for ‘procedural reasons’.  Previous hearings in March and February were also cancelled.
While Southwark’s housing waiting list accelerates upwards, developers Oakmayne and the Ministry of Sound have battled over the fate of this key development site.  The application was submitted in 2009 and rejected by Southwark in 2011.  The power of decision was then taken over by Boris Johnson, who has been reviewing it ever since.</p>

<p>One of Southwark’s grounds for rejecting the application was that it has no social rented housing, but this wasn’t an obstacle for the Elephant’s other ‘Towers of Shame’ – Strata Tower, One the Elephant, St Mary’s residential, Tribeca Square– which don’t have a single social rented unit amongst their 1500 homes.  The real obstacle has been determined objections from Ministry Of Sound, which fears future complaints from their new neighbours.
MoS’s concerns are no doubt well founded and young people have a legitimate need to dance themselves silly, but in a sensible world this would be trumped by the need of others for somewhere to live – not that this need will be properly met by another social housing-free development.</p>

<p>For its part Oakmayne  should be told – no social housing means no planning approval, but the chances of Mayor Johnson taking this view are non-existent.
MoS and Oakmayne pay lip-service to the aims of the regeneration but define it entirely in their own self-interested terms; local people (and Southwark Council) have been reduced to bystanders.</p>

<p><strong>N.B.:</strong>Oakmayne, like <a href="/images/StrataLRTitle.pdf">Strata Tower developers</a> are registered as an offshore company on the Isle of Man and therefore pay no UK tax. This setup also <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/16/london-property-tax-avoidance-offshore">enables it</a> to legally sell its flats while avoiding the payment of stamp duty.</p>

<h2>SHOPPING CENTRE LATEST</h2>


<p><img class="left" src="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/1255443526_80.177.117.97.jpg" width="300" height="200">Battle lines are also being drawn over the road at the Elephant shopping centre.  Southwark Council leader Peter John <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7151">told the council assembly</a> that he expected shopping centre owners St Modwen to deliver a development plan by the end of the year. He ruled out refurbishment as an acceptable option. Previously head of regeneration Cllr Fiona Colley <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7077">had also said</a> the shopping centre would be demolished. St Modwen’s say very little, though there have been press reports that they might sell up, with Lendlease rumoured as purchasers.
One thing continues unchanged – shopkeepers and their customers have been left out of this conversation.
The shopping centre is much ridiculed, but an awful lot of people work, shop and socialise there and it is time they were brought into the arguments about its future.</p>

<h2>BOX PARK MARK II</h2>


<p><img class="left" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ujXl9dbqKE8/UYfaKxGkomI/AAAAAAAABDE/FC250zOeDRU/s1600/IMG_3352.JPG" width="300" height="200">The consultation period for the second planning application for the <a href="/blog/2013/06/22/a-little-bit-of-shoreditch/">Box Park</a> has just ended, although comments will still be received by Southwark planning.  The park has grown in size to 56 units (each a shipping container) and been moved down the road from the Shell garage to the corner of Walworth Rd and Elephant Rd, formerly Elephant Park.
<img class="right" src="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/elephant-rd.jpg" width="300" height="200">Many remember that the London Latin American community used to have a <a href="http://www.thefirstpint.co.uk/2011/04/16/londons-heygate-estate-the-end-of-utopia/">football league here</a>, before the Park had to be <a href="https://elephantamenity.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/no-more-football-on-the-elephant-park/">given up</a> to the <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3641">Tribeca Square development</a>; developers Delancey say they can manage without it after all, so it now looks like a needless sacrifice.
This aside, nearby Wansey St residents welcome the move of the Box Park away from their immediate vicinity.<br/>
Other changes include the name (it is now known as The Artworks), dropping the live/work element of the proposal, which was met with scepticism from the many artists and artisans in the area, and the inclusion of a marketing suite for Lendlease, developers of the Heygate estate.  Otherwise the application proposes a similiar mix of  uses – retail, café, restaurant, indoor market, business workspace, gallery, community space – although the extent of each is not specified.
It will be a temporary development for five years and the applicants are asking that the usual s106 contributions (for mitigating the impact of developments) be waived in this instance, partly because of its temporary nature, partly because the s106 benefits are supposedly included in the application already.
Curiously, Artworks has not withdrawn the previous application for the Shell garage site, saying simply that it has <strong> <em>‘..yet to be determined by the Council’.</em> </strong>  The new application’s reference  number is 13/AP/2927; planning documents can be found <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeDocs&amp;TheSystemkey=9551217">here.</a></p>

According to <a href="http://www.c40cities.org/c40blog/leading-the-way-forward-progress-in-australia">C40 Cities Group</a> - a group of cities world-wide combating the effects of climate change - <strong> <em>‘Climate Positive Development Partners have made a commitment to achieve net-negative, on-site, operational greenhouse gas emissions’</em> </strong>.</p>

<p>The Elephant’s regeneration <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8056859.stm">first attracted</a> the Clinton foundation’s attention while it still included plans for having a Multi Utilities Services Company (MUSCo) as part of the Heygate and shopping centre redevelopment. This would have produced 100% renewable energy on-site, with zero carbon emissions, and possibly more than was needed, making it ‘carbon positive’.</p>

<h4> MUSCo vs Emission Reductions</h4>


<p><img class="left" src="http://www.bdunlop.com/images/Elephant-and-Castle/energy_envrnmtl-services_lge.gif" width="300" height="200">The Global Climate Initiative participant status has been awarded to Lend Lease for reducing operational emissions, in other words reducing day-to-day C02 emissions from homes and businesses. The MUSCo would have done more than this: it would have provided its own renewable energy making the entire development self-sufficient. The <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5052">MUSCo was dropped</a> from the Regeneration Agreement Southwark signed with Lend Lease in 2010.
Instead of producing renewable energy on-site through the MUSCo Lend Lease are planning to buy in biomethane gas from off-site producers, rather like using a green electricity tariff.
A close reading of this <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeResultDetail&amp;TheSystemkey=9550213">Energy Strategy</a> tells us that while it might have won an award from Bill Clinton, it does not conform to Southwark Council’s planning policy requirements:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/page11.jpg"></p>

<p>Lend Lease assert that notwithstanding this failure, energy emissions will be over 50% less than they would have been without the its strategy of ‘energy hierarchy principles and…energy commitment’. It also lives in hope that Southwark will have a change of heart;</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/page112.jpg"></p>

<p>In short, Lend Lease’s energy strategy is simply to buy in biomethane gas and hope that Southwark brings its planning policy into line with its proposals.</p>

<p>Biomethane can be a good source of renewable energy but it does need plant to produce it, which is why Southwark&rsquo;s policy requires it to be on-site. The policy needs improving too: the renewables requirement currently stands at 20%, the MUSCo would have provided 100% - which is what is needed if we want truly sustainable cities.</p>

Regeneration Cabinet member Councillor Fiona Colley <a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/development/council-to-refuse-demands-about-heygate-estate/6528392.article">blames</a> a minority of people looking fruitlessly for something sinister.<br/>
Cllr Colley misses the point: the problem isn’t that there might be something sinister going on, the problem is that Southwark has lost about 600 social rented units because Elephant developers routinely use viability assessments to avoid building them.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/1358323753_46.233.70.67.jpg" width="300" height="200">Taken together the Strata Tower, 360 Tower, Tribeca Square, Heygate estate and &lsquo;One the Elephant&rsquo; will deliver about 4000 units, but only 79 social rented homes  - there should be nearly  ten times that amount, 700 or so if Southwark had stuck to its affordable housing policy.  All these developments used financial viability assessments.  An <a href="/blog/2013/07/30/how-to-avoid-providing-affordable-housing-a-guide-for-developers/">earlier blog post</a> shows that providing them is a small industry.  The trick is to get one which shows that there will be less than 20% profit, after all values, costs and sales revenue are accounted for. The development is then classed as unviable and the affordable housing can be dropped.</p>

<p>Developers hide their assessments behind &lsquo;commercial confidentiality&rsquo;.  This prevents planning committee members from seeing them.  The same councillors are expected to approve the planning applications nonetheless and more often than not do so.  In fact there is probably little developers don&rsquo;t know about each other’s working methods; they are more concerned that the public doesn&rsquo;t get an insight into their ways of doing business.  </p>

<p>Nor are developers likely to desert Southwark, just because one of them has to reveal a financial viability assessment. Viability assessments are made public in other circumstances, such as developer’ appeals against adverse planning decisions, and the profits to be realised from Southwark&rsquo;s advantages as a central London borough will remain a big attraction.</p>

<p>Lend Lease were fully aware of Southwark Council&rsquo;s 35% affordable housing policy when it pitched to become the development partner. It signed the regeneration agreement in 2007, which pledged to provide half of the affordable housing as social rented housing. It has successfully beaten down the amount of affordable housing to 25%, and it has successfully reduced the amount of social rented housing to almost zero - all on the strength of confidential dealings including the financial viability assessment.  The public have a right to see it. </p>

<h2>Linden homes see the light</h2>


<p><img class="right" src="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/1378318437_80.177.117.97.jpg" width="300" height="300">The successful planning application for the <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7066">Linden Homes development</a> at St. Georges Circus was accompanied by the usual financial viability assessment pleading poverty. On this occasion however - and much to its credit - Southwark Council refused to accept this plea, and at the twelfth hour planning permission the developer discovered he could provide more affordable housing after all.  Notwithstanding the other merits of the application (there were many local objections) this shows what can be achieved when you stand your ground. Let&rsquo;s hope Southwark learns the lesson. </p>

<h2>To demolish or not to demolish……</h2>


<p><img class="left" src="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/1305725970_80.177.117.97.jpg" width="400" height="300">Southwark’s announcement last week that the shopping centre was to be demolished caught everyone by surprise, including the shopkeepers judging by <a href="http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,26548,185,00.htm">local newspaper reports</a>. The headlines emphasise the demolition and Cllr Fiona Colley is quoted saying that it has been agreed with owners St Modwen and the Greater London Authority.  St Modwen seems less sure – it just says that they remain committed to redevelopment and delivering a viable scheme.  Southwark has the alternative of compulsory purchase if needs be, but that could be a bruising battle.</p>

<p>Like the Heygate estate, the shopping centre has always been viewed as an obstacle by the champions of regeneration and from their point of view demolition makes sense.  St Modwen failed in their bid to become the regeneration partner and hasn’t engaged with the local community at all about their ideas, so Southwark Council cannot be blamed for asserting itself against them.  But just as on the Heygate the interests of the current occupants seem to be incidental.  The shopkeepers and the stall holders that cluster around the centre serve the people who live at the Elephant now, but are in the dark about what is going on.  Doesn’t the future include them?</p>

<p>The decision to demolish or not should not be left just to the big guns. Shopkeepers and the local community must be allowed their say.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/images/diewelt.png" width="300" height="300">Last week German national newspaper <em>Die Welt</em> <a href="http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article119060642/Grossbritannien-auf-dem-Weg-zum-Armenhaus-der-EU.html">featured</a> this picture of the Heygate as a symbol of Britain&rsquo;s social decline and the <em>&ldquo;Krieg der Reichen gegen die Armen&rdquo;</em> - the war of the rich against the poor.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/LLhereandnow.png" width="300" height="200">By coincidence Lend Lease have just submitted a <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeDocs&amp;TheSystemkey=9550740">planning application</a> featuring the same image but with a more promising message: <strong>change and transformation - <em>Here and Now</em> </strong>. Lend Lease were no doubt inspired by the prominent piece of graffiti either side of the banner, and it must also know that in Latin <em>Here and Now</em> means &lsquo;hic et nunc&rsquo; - the immediate satisfaction of desire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_phrases_(H)">according to Wikipedia</a>. Lend Lease&rsquo;s desire for profit is being satisfied pretty immediately: <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7047">it expects</a> to draw its first profit from the E&amp;C development in 2016, while the Heygate development as a whole is not due to be completed until 2025. Globally it reported a profit of £320m ($553 AUD) in its <a href="http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20130823/pdf/42hvw1dsw9q47d.pdf">annual report</a> last week.</p>

<h2>Here and Now 2</h2>


<p><img class="right" src="http://www.newmarkpi.com/images/D_07_l.jpg" width="300" height="200">Chatelaine House on the Walworth road is yet another proposed development in the Elephant &amp; Castle opportunity area that doesn&rsquo;t fulfill affordable housing requirements. The <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeResultDetail&amp;TheSystemkey=9549289">planning application</a> is for 54 homes plus 5,000m2 of shops, offices and restaurants. There will be only 14 &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; units - 10 social rented and 4 intermediate, equating to around 25% of the total number of new homes. The target date for the planning decision was the end of this month. There is no officer&rsquo;s report yet on the application, so it is not clear whether the social rented units will be at council rent levels or the new so-called &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; rents of up to 80% market.</p>

<p>The viability assessment for the Chatelaine House development was prepared by <a href="http://www.upsidelondon.com/">&lsquo;Upside London&rsquo;</a>, a consultancy formed just a year ago with the motto &lsquo;Making Development Viable&rsquo;. The company doesn&rsquo;t have a website yet, so we can&rsquo;t see whether it features <a href="http://www.s106management.co.uk/how-it-works">images of developers wheeling away barrows laden with cash</a>. <em>Upside London</em> was joined by dozens of other property developers, estate agents and public sector representatives at a <a href="http://www.peoplesrepublicofsouthwark.co.uk/hold-news/mqt/files/category/12-planning?download=189:planning-in-london-conference-afternoon">recent conference</a> on achieving viable developments in London. Looking at its title <em>&ldquo;Very taxing: Is viability vanishing as charges and levies hit London development?&rdquo;</em> it would seem that all participants think that London is very lucky to be getting any affordable housing at all.</p>

<h2>Come on Eileen!</h2>

The <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeResultDetail&amp;TheSystemkey=9531326">updated application</a> is worse: it still has no social rented housing, it has reduced the shared-ownership units by 15 units to 65, and has increased the private units by the same number from 255 to 270.</p>

Boris Johnson has just announced that the UK&rsquo;s largest private rental development will be right at the heart of the Elephant &amp; Castle. The <em>360 Tower</em> on the old London Park Hotel site will provide 462 new homes, most of which will be for free-market rent. 188 will be &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; but mostly shared ownership, and a meagre 29 units - initially social rented - have since been <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/MD1240%20Newington%20MD%20Part%201%20PDF.pdf">turned into so-called &lsquo;affordable rent&rsquo;</a>. Needless to say that this is way below the 80 social rented units required by planning policy, and way beyond the means of most people living in Southwark<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. Today&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/tenancies/major-flaws-revealed-in-pay-to-stay-policy/6528085.article"><em>Inside Housing</em> article</a> reveals that the minimum salary needed for an &lsquo;affordable rent&rsquo; flat in Southwark is £46,790 pa.</p>

<p>Of the 188 &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; units 159 will be shared ownership. We have no information about how much they will cost, but Southwark Council&rsquo;s income threshold for shared ownership is currently around £30,000 per year for a 1-bed flat.</p>

<strong>The past&hellip;</strong><br/>
The site was formerly home to the London Park Hotel, which provided low-cost accommodation including accommodation for asylum seekers. It was <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3475">bought by</a> Government agency &lsquo;English Partnerships&rsquo; for £18m in order to provide affordable housing for key workers. The current development was given planning permission by Southwark Council in 2007. The developers were then First Base, <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/2835">part of the Lend Lease consortium</a> selected as the council&rsquo;s E&amp;C development partner. The site then passed hands from English Partnerships to the Homes and Communities Agency and finally to the GLA. Along the way First Base dropped out, the overall amount of affordable housing was reduced and then the commitment to provide key-worker housing was dropped in January 2010. <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3475">In 2008</a>, chair of Southwark&rsquo;s planning committee James Gurling noted the <em>&ldquo;&lsquo;dreadful irony&rsquo; that the Government had spent millions of pounds acquiring the site – part of it from Southwark Council – for housing for people who can&rsquo;t afford it and now the committee was being asked to back a reduction in the number of such homes. A lot of money has gone round in a big circle and the net losers will be the people who need the help most.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>&hellip; and the future</strong><br/>
<img class="right" src="http://www.housingexcellence.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/large_490x270/public/Archway.jpg?itok=OXcNjsbc" width="300" height="200"><br/>
The <em>360 Tower</em> is now being funded by <a href="http://www.m3cp.com/">M3 Capital Partners</a> - a global real-estate investment company originally part of the Australian <a href="http://www.macquarie.com/">Macquarie group</a>. The tower will be managed by its subsidiary company <a href="http://www.essentialliving.uk.com/"><em>Essential Living</em></a> whose <a href="http://www.essentialliving.uk.com/">aim it is</a> to <em>&ldquo;revolutionise the private rental market&rdquo;</em>. <em>Essential Living</em> has recently become very active in Britain and has <a href="http://shbm-news.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/essential-livings-bethnal-green-scheme.html">5,000 new homes in its planning pipeline</a>. One of its projects is the controversial Archway Tower, and <em>Essential Living</em> <a href="http://www.housingexcellence.co.uk/news/london%E2%80%99s-archway-tower-become-rental-homes-gentrification-plan">makes no bones</a> about what its aim is: <em>&ldquo;Archway deserves regeneration and we believe our investment will be the catalyst to further gentrification in this important North London community.”</em></p>

<p> In a <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmcomloc/writev/953/prs125.htm">recent submission</a> to a parliamentary inquiry <em>Essential Living</em> asked for:</p>

<ul>
<li>The continued sale of public land to the private sector</li>
<li>Limits to lifetime and fixed-term tenancies for affordable housing</li>
<li>A relaxation of s106 contributions</li>
</ul>


<p><em>Essential Living</em> offers itself as an alternative to buy-to-let landlords who they <a href="http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/rogers-stirk-harbour-tower-to-be-a-uk-first/5058596.article">describe as amateurs</a>, but it admits that the costs of building, maintaining and managing their homes in the new American style setup will be more expensive, and is asking for changes in the way the viability of its developments is assessed within the planning process. Large developments must provide public benefits through <a href="/blog/2013/07/30/how-to-avoid-providing-affordable-housing-a-guide-for-developers/">s106 contributions</a>; these will be reduced if <em>Essential Living</em> gets its way.</p>

<p>Mayor Johnson thinks that M3 capital partners are the perfect new landlords. He hopes they will start a trend: <a href="http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/rogers-stirk-harbour-tower-to-be-a-uk-first/5058596.article">he said:</a> <em>“This ‘holy grail’ of investment in the riskier pre-development stage is a hugely important milestone but it is just the beginning. I want to entice other institutional investors to come forward and invest in quality homes for Londoners.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Essential Living?</strong><br/>
<em>Essential Living</em> do not appear to have any completed developments where we can see what their rent levels are, but if the so-called &lsquo;affordable rents&rsquo; are going to require an income of £46,790 per year, then we can confidently predict that the free-market rents won&rsquo;t come cheap.</p>

<p>Private rental and &lsquo;affordable rent&rsquo; don&rsquo;t feature anywhere in the policies or plans for the regeneration of Elephant &amp; Castle, but the <em>360 Tower</em> and <a href="/blog/2013/08/03/the-whole-world-comes-to-the-elephant/"><em>One the Elephant</em></a> show us that both will play a significant role, and that much of the regeneration&rsquo;s housing will be neither affordable nor owner-occupied. The Elephant &amp; Castle regeneration - Europe&rsquo;s largest regeneration scheme - is quickly becoming a property-investment bonanza, one moreover that is being funded through the disposal of public land.

<div id="appeal">
<h2>Stop the Press!</h2>
It was confirmed on Friday by the Information Tribunal that Southwark Council have appealed against the <a href="/blog/2013/07/24/heygate-figures-must-b-be-revealed-information-commissioner/">Information Commissioner&#8217;s decision</a> to order Southwark to disclose the Heygate masterplan viability assessment, submitted by developer Lend Lease in its planning application. Southwark have requested a hearing at which they will argue that while they <a href="http://youtu.be/sbSCIuaLFQ4">believe in openness and transparency</a>, on this occasion it would be best if the public was kept in the dark.
