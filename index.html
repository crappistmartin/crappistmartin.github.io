  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.mipimuk-awards.co.uk/mipimukawards2014/shortlist"><img class="right" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/MipimAwards.jpg" width="350" height="230"></a>Southwark prides itself on being a &lsquo;developer friendly&rsquo; borough. It has been <a href="http://vimeo.com/71882474#t=125s">endorsed</a> by Lend Lease Director Rob Deck as a <strong>&lsquo;can do&rsquo;</strong> council and it has been <a href="http://www.mipimuk-awards.co.uk/mipimukawards2014/shortlist">shortlisted</a> (by developers) for the award of <strong>&lsquo;Best UK Planning Authority&rsquo;</strong> at next week&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.mipimuk.co.uk/"><strong>MIPIM</strong> jamboree</a>. But pressure is mounting on all councils including Southwark to withdraw from the MIPIM backscratching get-together. Over two dozen community groups, charities and trade unions have <a href="http://radicalhousingnetwork.org/mipim-uk/whos-opposing-mipim/">opposed MIPIM</a>. Unite, Britains largest union has <a href="http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/labour-councillors-urged-to-boycott-property-developers-fair-as-londons-housing-crisis-mounts/">written</a> to all of London&rsquo;s Labour-controlled councils  asking them to <em>&ldquo;withdraw from participation in MIPIM and the close relationships with private developers that the event seeks to foster.&rdquo;</em>; three have done so but not Southwark.</p>

<p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BzdVDNBCAAMCUu0.png"><img class="left" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BzdVDNBCAAMCUu0.png" width="350" height="230"></a>So it is a particulary embarrasing moment for Lend Lease to <a href="http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20141009/pdf/42ss0tfmnqrw92.pdf">announce</a> on the Sydney Stock Exchange pre-sales totalling £312m (AUD$ 570m) from just 20% of the 3,000 homes it is building at the Elephant &amp; Castle. As we detailed in our <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/09/20/setting-the-record-straight/">previous blog</a>, Southwark is going to have to wait 11 years before it gets a sniff of any profit from the Heygate and so far Southwark has received just £15m of its £50m Heygate land receipt while having spent over £65m emptying and demolishing the estate.</p>

<h2>Developers behaving badly</h2>

<p>Some good examples of bad behaviour by developers using viability assessments to avoid building affordable housing are beginning to emerge.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/neobanksidecomparison.jpg" width="400" height="300">In Southwark, properties in the Neo Bankside development, opposite Tate Modern, were  <a href="http://www.colliers.com/~/media/Files/EMEA/UK/research/residential/201202-central-london-residential-market.pdf">reported</a> to be selling for an average of <strong>£1,326 per square foot</strong> in 2012, nearly double that claimed by developer <strong>Grosvenor</strong> when planning permission was granted: <strong>Grosvenor</strong>&rsquo;s <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/6014_1.pdf">viability assessment</a> claimed its residential properties would sell for an average of just <strong>£754 per square foot</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. These figures also take no account of the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/europe-house-of-the-day-luxury-penthouse-on-the-bank-of-the-thames-photos-1412674116">unsold penthouses</a>, which are <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7512">currently on the market</a> for £22m (each).</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/NEOBanksidePenthouse.jpg" width="300" height="200">Southwark Council didn&rsquo;t refer the Neo Bankside viability assessment to the <a href="http://www.voa.gov.uk/DVS/index.html">District Valuer</a> or other independent expert for appraisal, but had its Internal Property Division look it over instead<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Its Property team recommended that the council accept the developer&rsquo;s poverty plea and settle for a <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5356">conciliatory offer of a £9m in-lieu payment</a>. Based on Southwark&rsquo;s in-lieu affordable housing tariff <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> this was a whopping gain to the developer of £16.2m.
The absence of any review or reappraisal mechanism in the planning approval, means that there is no chance that Southwark - or anyone in Southwark who needs affordable housing - will benefit from the properties being sold for twice the developer&rsquo;s original estimate.</p>

<p>Developer <strong>Grosvenor</strong>&rsquo;s viability assessment can currently be <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/6014_1.pdf">viewed</a> on the council&rsquo;s planning portal. We presume this was a mistake by Southwark, so in the event that it gets removed we have uploaded a backup copy which can be viewed online <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/6014_1.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/SKMBT_DVSReport.pdf"><img class="right" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/DVSReport.png" width="200" height="350"></a>In Kensington &amp; Chelsea, the <a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/SKMBT_DVSReport.pdf">District Valuer&rsquo;s report</a> evaluating the developer&rsquo;s viability assessment for the Earl&rsquo;s Court regeneration was <a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/development/earls-court-developer-ignored-house-price-rises/7005985.article">finally disclosed</a> thanks to the efforts of local campaigners. The report was highly critical, stating that the developer&rsquo;s assessment <em>&ldquo;ignores residential growth in values that occurs between construction start on site and the commencement of marketing and phased release of the dwellings&rdquo;</em>. The report concluded by recommending that the council implement a <em>‘review mechanism’</em> so that it could increase the level of affordable housing in line with changing market conditions throughout the 22 year scheme. Unfortunately, no such review mechanism was put in place.</p>

<p>In Fitzrovia, developer <strong>TMCT Associates</strong> has adopted a different tack: instead of underestimating sales values it has inflated build costs in its application for an office to residential conversion at Eastgate House, just around the corner from Tottenham Court Rd. As is usually the case here and elsewhere, Westminster planning committee were initially denied access to the viability assessment, but councillors have now demanded to see it. <a href="http://fitzrovia.org.uk/">Fitzrovia Neighbourhood Association</a> has got there first, and it has published <a href="http://news.fitzrovia.org.uk/2014/10/09/affordable-housing-viability-and-profit/">an account</a> of what it found in its newspaper Fitzrovia News. The Developer has estimated that it will cost a staggering £1.2m <strong>per flat</strong> to convert from offices to residential.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://ystudio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gp2.jpg" width="300" height="200">Over in the huge <a href="http://knightdragon.com/greenwich-peninsula/current">Greenwich Peninsula regeneration</a> of 10,000 homes, Hong Kong developer <a href="http://knightdragon.com/"><strong>Knight Dragon</strong></a> has secured a reduction in the amount of affordable housing from 38% to 21%. Local campaigners City Peninsula Residents Association are fighting back and are due to appear at an Information Tribunal hearing in January in their efforts to reveal the viability assessment, which justifies the loss of around 1,700 affordable homes. The use of viability assessments in Greenwich <a href="http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/11500983._Pushing_poor_people_out____Greenwich_accused_of_affordable_housing_failure/">appears to be rampant</a>: none of the approved major developments over the last 12 months meets Greenwich&rsquo;s minimum requirement for 35% affordable housing.</p>

<h2>The benefit of review mechanisms</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BprjPdsCQAEG0ze.png" width="300" height="200">A recurring feature of planning approvals involving viability assessments is the absence of any review mechanism. This means that any uplift in London property prices between the approval of planning and sale of new homes will not be reflected in an increased affordable housing offer. This will be the case on the Heygate estate, where Southwark failed to follow the District Valuer&rsquo;s recommendation that a <em>&lsquo;review mechanism linked with delivery&rsquo;</em> should be made a condition of planning approval<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. The 37% increase in Southwark&rsquo;s property prices since The Heygate planning application was submitted, will therefore be translated directly into developer profit; the £101m worth of affordable housing that Lend Lease said it couldn&rsquo;t afford to provide remains permanently written off. The Heygate development is not due to be completed until 2025. Any further increase in London property prices over the next 11 years will be converted into Lend Lease profit; the measly affordable housing offer of 79 social rented units out of 2,735 new homes will remain unchanged.</p>

<p>Review/re-appraisal mechanisms for viability assessments don&rsquo;t just make good sense: as well as being in Southwark&rsquo;s case a policy requirement<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>, they are recommended in the official RICS guidance on viability testing<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Some other councils are starting to wake up to the problem of the misuse of viability assessments: Inside Housing <a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/islingtons-planning-backlash-at-developer-super-profits/7005936.article">reported</a> that Islington Council plans to <em>&ldquo;clamp down on ‘artificially pessimistic’ viability studies used by developers to minimise affordable housing obligations.&rdquo;</em> Islington Council said it comes after it had <em>&ldquo;received a ‘significant number’ of viability studies that do not provide underlying methodology and modelling. These studies are ‘unsupported by robust evidence’ and create ‘an artificially pessimistic outcome’.&rdquo;</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/SNHeygateOverage.pdf"><img src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/SN1100homes.png" width="400" align="right"></a>Southwark Council leader Peter John has pledged that the 11,000 new council homes to be built over the next 30 years will not entail the demolition of the same number of existing council homes. In an <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/10997/an_open_letter_from_cllr_peter_john_leader_of_southwark_council">open letter</a> to all residents Cllr John says;</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;To be absolutely clear, the 11,000 new homes that we promise to deliver will be new homes additional to our existing stock. These will be council homes on council rents for those that need them. It has been said that what we are intending to do is demolish 11,000 existing council homes and replace them to reach our target of 11,000. This is just not true. These are new homes and do not include the existing stock of council housing.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/200463/community_conversations/2923/lets_talk_about_new_council_homes_for_southwark"><img src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/communityconversation.png" width="300" height="200" align="left"></a>This emphatic promise has been prompted by residents’ concern about some of the questions Southwark are asking in their <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/200463/community_conversations/2923/lets_talk_about_new_council_homes_for_southwark">resident survey</a> entitled <strong>‘Let’s talk about&hellip;new council homes for Southwark’</strong>. The survey seeks resident approval of a Charter of Principals for how the Council <em>‘will work with residents on our programme of investment and renewal’</em>. The <a href="http://www.sgto.org.uk/">Southwark Group of Tenants Association</a>&rsquo;s newsletter (issue 15) says that the survey <em>‘seems to confuse the building of 11,000 homes with the ‘renewal’ or ‘redevelopment’ of estates’</em>. Southwark Defend Council Housing puts it stronger - <em>‘Southwark Council threatens massive redevelopment of its housing estates in Camberwell &amp; Peckham’</em>, and links the questions to Southwark’s new CIL <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/07/23/mystery-objector-1301/"><em>‘Estate Renewal Zone&#8217;</em></a>.</p>

<h3>..the price tag</h3>

<p><img src="http://35percent.org/images/CILChargingZones.png" width="200" align ="right">All agree that building 11,000 council homes is a good promise and is off to a good start<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but the promise now looks as if it has a price attached, a price which the resident survey is very artfully concealing. The survey talks of ‘principles’ and ‘pledges’ but makes no mention of the asset appraisal study of council stock that will determine which estates are chosen for redevelopment, nor the part the survey itself will play in making those choices. The asset appraisal study is due to be completed by December and is described in a recent council <a href="http://moderngov.southwarksites.com/documents/s47488/Report%20Long%20term%20plans%20for%20the%20delivery%20of%20new%20council%20homes.pdf">cabinet report - ‘Next steps on Developing Long Term Plans for the Delivery of New Council Homes’</a>. The report says that the council must <em>‘identify as much potential land as possible for development opportunity’</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. This requires <em>‘a detailed and comprehensive appraisal be undertaken of the performance of the Housing Revenue Account (HRA) assets’</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> (ie council homes), leading to <em>‘an assessment of their worth to the housing business’</em><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>..the <strong>Asset Performance Evaluation Tool</strong></h3>

<p>Establishing the financial ‘worth’ of each council home does not end the process. Southwark will also look at ‘non-financial’ factors – income, employment, health, education and social exclusion – to see which stock <em>‘prevents the council effectively meeting its social housing objectives’</em><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. An <em>&lsquo;Asset Performance Evaluation Tool&rsquo;</em>, which includes <em>‘a measure of social return based on feedback from engagement with residents’</em><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, will ‘enable’ the council to reach its decisions.</p>

<p>Finally Southwark will make <em>‘a correlation of these results with open market values and development potential across the stock will identify candidate groups of assets where more detailed options appraisal could result in either opportunities for additional homes or improvements in values to the overall HRA business plan, increasing the surpluses that may be available to subsidise new developments.’</em><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Putting all this into plain English, Southwark will put a financial value on each of its estates, take a look at the lifestyles of its tenants and residents and estimate how much the land is worth to developers. The ‘options’ will then open up, including sell-offs (aka ‘improvements in value to the overall HRA business plan’). Putting it even more simply, it looks like Southwark will;</p>

<ul>
<li>see how much each council estate is worth&hellip;</li>
<li>see which ones it doesn’t like&hellip;.</li>
<li>see which ones it wants to ‘redevelop’&hellip;.</li>
</ul>


<p>This all paints a rather alarming picture, particularly in light of the Heygate experience where an <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2012/12/23/1998-southwark-housing-stock-survey/">options appraisal study</a> which recommended retaining half the estate&rsquo;s buildings was ignored. The 35% campaign has requested a copy of the <strong>&lsquo;Asset Performance Evaluation Tool&rsquo;</strong> given the key part it looks like playing in the future of every Southwark council estate resident.</p>

<h2>Aylesbury - Stop Press</h2>

<p>The long-anticipated outline planning application and phase 1b/1c demolition applications have been submitted to Southwark Council. Residents in the first phase have received <a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/scan0027.pdf">this letter</a> from agents acting on behalf of Notting Hill Housing Trust and Barratt. However, despite having been submitted on 25th September, there are no planning documents online yet. All we know at the moment is that the outline application is for 2,745 new &lsquo;private and affordable units&rsquo; including 1,070 parking spaces plus retail, office &amp; community space. The detailed application proposals include 815 new homes, new roads and some <em>&lsquo;public and private open space&rsquo;</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://tradingplaces-elephant.tumblr.com/"><img class="right" src="http://33.media.tumblr.com/eb768bd9c749502c3d8926ced246593f/tumblr_nbcjwdMLuv1tklzg2o1_1280.jpg" width="200" height="300"></a>We <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/07/12/the-more-rent-seeking-elephants-at-elephant-the-better/">blogged</a> on 12th July about <a href="http://www.social-life.co/blog/post/Trading_Places_Elephant_and_Castle_regen/"><em>Social Life</em></a>, a social enterprise based on the Pullens estate. They have now completed their research on the Elephant &amp; Castle shopping centre redevelopment and how it is affecting the traders there. A concise and impressive report is now available <a href="http://tradingplaces-elephant.tumblr.com/">here</a>. Its conclusions will not surprise people familiar with the shopping centre. It says: <em>&ldquo;Overall, traders are anxious and concerned about the redvelopment. Many of the traders have mixed feelings about the plans.&rdquo;</em>;<em>&ldquo;The shopping centre is an important social space for traders, local people and regular customers and it plays a hugely important role in the social life of the local community.&rdquo;</em>;<em>&ldquo;The shopping centre supports dense networks of social relationships in the local area, across London and globally.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>We hope developers Delancey have read this report and are giving it full weight in their forthcoming planning application for the shopping centre&rsquo;s redevelopment. However, we hear from several sources that they are not treating the current occupants very well: rents are being raised and new rental agreements are in the form of licences rather than leases, which points towards them getting rid of shopkeepers rather than keeping them. An <a href="http://www.theprisma.co.uk/2014/09/21/how-changes-in-elephant-castle-will-affect-the-latino-community/">interview</a> with respected academic and Director of <a href="http://latinelephant.wordpress.com/">Latin Elephant</a> Patria Roman paints a similar picture. Nevertheless, one shopping centre leaseholder and popular venue for Latin American events appears to be fighting back - the <a href="https://www.change.org/p/southwark-council-save-the-coronet">&lsquo;Save the Coronet&rsquo; petition</a> now stands at 3,856 signatures.</p>

<h2>Sorting Office sorted?</h2>


<p><img class="left" src="http://walworthsociety.co.uk/images/Copy%20of%20image%20001%20-%20resized.jpg" width="300" height="150">Two contentious planning applications are pending just down the road from the Elephant in Walworth. One of these would see the effective demolition of a local heritage asset - the former sorting office on Penrose street, the other could jeopardise the future of much loved and valued local mental health charity <em>Cooltan Arts</em>.</p>

<p>The Sorting Office was built in 1897 and the Walworth Society has long been <a href="http://walworthsociety.co.uk/index.php/blog/116-31-penrose-street-walworths-victorian-sorting-office">campaigning</a> to have it retained as part of the extensive redevelopment of the area. A previous planning application was refused after a large number of objections to its demolition. Its owner is now back with <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeDocs&amp;TheSystemkey=9554889">another application</a> which looks like a prime example of &lsquo;facadism&rsquo;: an increasingly common practice which has been <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/aug/25/front-facade-bad-developments-ruining-historic-buildings">described</a> in the development industry as a <em>&ldquo;wilful two fingers up&rdquo;</em> to local planners.</p>

<p>The application is for 6 x 3 storey and 2 x 2 storey town houses, 8 being just below Southwark&rsquo;s threshold for an affordable housing contribution. They will be squeezed behind the retained facade and side wall, but require the demolition of the rest of the sorting office and surrounding outbuildings.</p>

<h2>Cooltan Arts - threat</h2>


<p><img class="right" src="http://www.cooltanarts.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSCF4054-lr.jpg" width="300" height="200">Cooltan Arts, long term residents of the Walworth road were relocated last year on the <a href="http://www.cooltanarts.org.uk/2013/10/cooltan-arts-community-space-for-237-walworth-road/">promise</a> that they would be able to return to redveloped premises on their former site off the Walworth road. But a revised planning application for the site no longer contains this promise to reprovide space for Cooltan (nor does it contain the amount of affordable housing required by policy). Objections to the application <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeResultDetail&amp;TheSystemkey=9553921">ref:(14/AP/0830)</a> can still be sent to <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;&#112;&#108;&#x61;&#110;&#x6e;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#46;&#x61;&#x70;&#x70;&#108;&#105;&#99;&#97;&#116;&#x69;&#111;&#x6e;&#115;&#64;&#x73;&#111;&#x75;&#116;&#104;&#119;&#97;&#x72;&#107;&#46;&#x67;&#x6f;&#118;&#x2e;&#x75;&#107;&#x2e;">&#112;&#x6c;&#97;&#x6e;&#x6e;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#46;&#x61;&#112;&#x70;&#108;&#105;&#99;&#97;&#116;&#x69;&#111;&#110;&#x73;&#x40;&#x73;&#x6f;&#x75;&#116;&#x68;&#119;&#97;&#114;&#x6b;&#46;&#x67;&#x6f;&#x76;&#x2e;&#x75;&#x6b;&#x2e;</a></p>

<h2>Developers award Southwark top marks</h2>


<p>Southwark Council has been <a href="http://www.mipimuk-awards.co.uk/mipimukawards2014/shortlist">shortlisted</a> for two awards at the latest property developers&#8217; jamboree <strong>&lsquo;MIPIM UK&rsquo;</strong>, due to be held at Kensington Olympia on 15th-17th October. Southwark is in the running to be both <em>&ldquo;UK best planning authority of the year&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;Public-Private Partnership of the Year&rdquo;</em> for the Aylesbury estate. The MIPIM awards <a href="http://www.mipimuk-awards.co.uk/mipimukawards2014/shortlist">web page</a> claims that for developers, Southwark is both <em>&ldquo;welcoming and demanding&rdquo;</em>. We agree that it is certainly welcoming but as we have shown, it is not so demanding - especially when it comes to enforcing its own minimum policies on affordable housing contributions.</p>

<p>MIPIM also states in the citation for the Aylesbury partnership award that 75% of its affordable housing will be social rented. We doubt very much that all the new social rented homes will be at social rents and suspect that the forthcoming Aylesbury outline planning application will replace at least some of it with the new so-called &lsquo;affordable rents&#8217;of up to 80% market rent.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/peter-j-mipim.jpg?w=500&h=409" width="375" height="375">MIPIM itself is usually held in sunny <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6687">Cannes</a>. In 2013 the Council leader was <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/SNCannesMipim.pdf">accused</a> of <em>&lsquo;going on a jolly&rsquo;</em> to the event paid for by developer Lend Lease and last year he <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7449">withdrew</a> after protests and demonstrations. This year it is proving equally controversial: several Councils have pulled out after media pressure and an <a href="http://southwarknotes.wordpress.com/2014/09/21/open-letter-to-southwark-council-to-not-attend-mipim/">open letter</a> signed by several local campaign groups asks Southwark to join them. So far Council leader Peter John is unimpressed.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://radicalhousingnetwork.org/">Radical Housing Network</a> is organising protests during the exhibiton on 15th - 17th October.</p>

<h2>Heygate viability assessment latest</h2>


<p>After a long appeal against the Information Commisioner&rsquo;s decision, the Information Tribunal ordered Southwark Council and Lend Lease to disclose the Heygate viability assessment back in May. The Tribunal extended the time for forwarding the assessment to the Information Commissioner back in June, but the assessment has still not been revealed. After inquiries to the Tribunal by Mr Glasspool who requested the information, a case management hearing has now been scheduled for 15th October.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Southwark Council has had its feathers ruffled by both the Guardian and the BBC lately. A <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/17/truth-property-developers-builders-exploit-planning-cities">Guardian article</a> by Oliver Wainright uses the redevelopment of the Heygate estate as an example of how developers are <em>&lsquo;exploiting planning authorities and ruining our cities&rsquo;</em>.</p>

<p>Southwark Council has posted a <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1785/setting_the_record_straight_the_true_value_of_the_elephant_and_castle_regeneration">press statement</a> <strong>&lsquo;setting the record straight&rsquo;</strong>, in which it claims it will receive <em>&ldquo;phased payments as the scheme progresses&rdquo;</em> and this will amount to <em>&ldquo;hundreds of millions&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf"><img class="center" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/HeygateLandReceipts.png"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf"><img class="right" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/rapage70.png" width="400" height="620"></a>It is true that there will be phased payments amounting to £50m (£46m for the main site + £4m for the Rodney road site) - this figure is now well known from the leaked <a href="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf">Regeneration Agreement</a>, but getting the <em>&ldquo;hundreds of millions&rdquo;</em> of pounds depends upon the so-called &lsquo;overage&rsquo; or &lsquo;super-profit&rsquo; and how much this will be, if anything, won&rsquo;t be known until the project is completed in 2025.</p>

<p>The overage will be what is left over after building costs, a 2.6% management fee and 20% priority developer return is deducted from the total sales revenue and it will be calculated according to Lend Lease&rsquo;s financial model, as detailed in a 3000 page spreadsheet known as Appendix 22 of the Heygate viability assessment. This complicated accounting process is entirely under Lend Lease&rsquo;s control and while the Council has the right to inspect the financial model, this may not guarantee the expected overage windfall as the Barangaroo Delivery Authority in Sydney Australia <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/barangaroo-public-works-in-doubt-after-government-loses-court-battle-with-lend-lease-20140821-106lke.html">is finding out</a> to its cost.</p>

<p>Any reckoning of the gain due to Southwark must also take into account the £65m<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> it has spent on Heygate decant costs plus an unquantified amount of public money devoted to regeneration since the wider E&amp;C scheme was conceived, starting with the £25m Single Regeneration Budget (SRB) funding received back in 1999.</p>

<p>On top of the Guardian’s Heygate story the BBC has taken up the plight of Aylesbury leaseholders being &lsquo;forced out of the city&rsquo;, with an <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-29098960">online article</a> and televised reports on both its London News and <a href="http://youtu.be/RtvghCKNJjQ">Inside Out programme</a> on 8th Sep. Inside Out did not think much of the paltry amount of compensation leaseholders on the Aylesbury estate were being offered, particularly in comparison to the £340k cost of one-bed properties in the area and described the situation as <em>&lsquo;the Right to Buy dream turned sour&rsquo;</em>.</p>

<p>Southwark again &lsquo;sets the record straight&rsquo; and <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1767/southwark_councils_full_response_to_bbc_inside_out_programme">insists</a> that offers such as <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/05/16/southwark-gives-green-light-to-slum-landlords/">£85k for a 1-bed flat</a> are based on <em>&ldquo;actual market evidence of properties being sold on the Aylesbury estate&rdquo;</em>. This method of basing valuations on the sales prices of other properties depressed by the prospect of demolition has been <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/05/30/aylesbury-leaseholder-fights-incestuous-valuation/">criticised</a> by the Lands Tribunal. Southwark Council&rsquo;s valuers are also pretty imaginative in the way they gather &lsquo;market evidence&rsquo;, using a <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/05/16/southwark-gives-green-light-to-slum-landlords/">1-bed property which had been illegally converted</a> to 4 beds flat as the basis of the compensation for one unfortunate leaseholder.  The derisory compensation offered to Aylesbury leaseholders is in stark contrast to the abundant profit that the builder of the Aylesbury redevelopment Barratt has just <a href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-2750592/Booming-UK-housing-market-fuels-doubling-annual-profits-Barratt.html">announced</a>.</p>

<p>The Guardian and BBC stories reflect a wide-spread public view that developers and housebuilders are making big profits at local people’s expense and taking Southwark for a ride (an <a href="https://www.change.org/p/heygate-estate-scandal-demand-an-investigation">online petition</a> demanding an investigation into the Heygate development has gained over 700 signatures in 3 days) and a couple of press releases from Southwark won’t change this view.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Notting Hill Housing Trust is an important provider of housing in Southwark, both &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; and <a href="http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,26531,440,00.htm">private</a>. It has plans to build more than 4000 homes in Southwark; 3500 of these will be on the Aylesbury estate, which it is redeveloping <a href="http://www.nottinghillhousing.org.uk/about-us/building-new-homes/our-developments/aylesbury-estate-southwark">in partnership</a> with Britain&rsquo;s largest - and the mayor&rsquo;s favourite - housebuilder Barratt Homes. According to the NHHT <a href="http://www.nottinghillhousing.org.uk/asset/view/6912.pdf">website</a>, a hybrid application comprising outline planning for the whole Aylesbury and detailed planning for the first phase is due to be submitted by the NHHT/Barratt consortium next month.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/development/greater-london-authority-allocates-404m-for-affordable-homes/7004790.article"><img class="left" src="http://35percent.org/images/nottinghillfunding.png" width="400" height="300"></a>Notting Hill has secured more money than any other housing association from the Mayor&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/housing-land/increasing-housing-supply/affordable-homes-programme">affordable housing fund</a> (£59m - nearly three times the amount of the next highest provider). However, it is <a href="http://www.cih.org/news-article/display/vpathDCR/templatedata/cih/news-article/data/Losing_social_homes_means_we_are_storing_up_trouble">well known</a> that a condition of getting money from this funding stream is that only affordable rented homes can be built - not social rented. This was <a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk//7005104.article">cited</a> by London Labour housing spokesperson Tom Copley as the reason why so few housing associations had applied for the funding, of which £380m still remains unallocated.</p>

<p>Notting Hill Housing Trust enthusiastically <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2014/06/16/notting-hill-housing-no-social-housing">endorses</a> the Mayor&rsquo;s affordable rent policies, which may explain why Boris Johnson is so happy to give it so much money.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://35percent.org/images/SouthwarkMarketRents.png">Aylesbury estate tenants will have the right to a tenancy in the new Notting Hill development and those already &lsquo;decanted&rsquo; to other parts of the borough will have the right to return, but if the affordable rents are 80% of market rent this won&rsquo;t mean very much. Southwark Council&rsquo;s recently published &lsquo;Affordable Rent Product Study&rsquo; gives £289pw as the market rent of a 1-bed flat in SE17 – 80% of this would be £231pw.  A council rent for a 1-bed flat in SE17 is currently around £100pw.</p>

<p>Southwark Council has repeatedly said in public that there would be 50% affordable housing on the new Aylesbury, of which 75% would be social rented and this was written into its <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/200211/area_action_plans/1327/aylesbury_area_action_plan">planning policy for the scheme</a>. Notting Hill Housing Trust now says that social rent is the same as affordable rent and probably thinks that people are too stupid to tell the difference.</p>

<p>We think that any Aylesbury tenant moving into one of the replacement homes should not be expected to pay much more than their current council rent. If Southwark doesn&rsquo;t want to see another Heygate-style diaspora of long-standing communities then it should hold good on its promises, stick to its policies and ensure that policy definitions are not allowed to be blurred.</p>

<h2>Notting Hill Housing Trust - Manor Place Depot</h2>


<p><img class="left" src="http://35percent.org/images/manorplace.jpg" width="300" height="200">We <a href="http://affordable.heroku.com/blog/2014/06/16/notting-hill-housing-no-social-housing/">blogged</a> in June about the prospect of no social housing in Notting Hill Housing&rsquo;s Manor Place Depot development. Since then NHHT appears to have had a change of heart.</p>

<p>One of our members visited NHHT&rsquo;s second exhibition for its Manor Place Depot development and reported back as follows:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The exhibition gave no figures for the housing , simply saying some of the housing would be affordable rent, of which social rent was as a subset.  However discussions with NHHT staff yielded the following information:</em></p>

<p><em>The 35% target for affordable housing would be met, with 95 units out of the 270 proposed.  Of these 95 units, 50% will be affordable rent and 50% shared ownership.  NHHT defines affordable rent as including social rent, and there will be some social rent though they don&rsquo;t know how much until the viability assessment.  NHHT policy, they say, is for all the family units to be at social rent.</em></p>

<p><em>Since the first exhibition, NHHT has received GLA funds for all of its sites.  This contributes £30,000 - £40,000 of the cost per unit, they say.  NHHG were unwilling to provide information as to what exact tenure mix this public funding will subsidise, and how it differs per site.</em></p>

<p><em>On affordable market rent, NHHT say they don&rsquo;t go anywhere near 80% market rent and have a cap in London of £230 (i.e. this is the maximum affordable market rent they will charge, they say).</em></p>

<p><em>They said that there will be a further exhibition in September/October ahead of the planning application in November/December.&ldquo;</em></p>

<h4>We say:</h4>


<p>Social rented housing and affordable rented housing are not one and the same thing, Notting Hill Housing Trust needs to stop muddying the waters. If it wants to start consulting meaningfully with local people it must tell them exactly how much social rented housing there will be and how much affordable rented housing there will be and exactly how much rent they will be charging for each.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A £64m funding gap for the infrastructure improvements of the Elephant &amp; Castle regeneration has been identified by Southwark Council. The figure is given in its <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/10740/addendum_to_cdeip1">submission</a> to the Government inspector examining Southwark&rsquo;s plans for raising funds from developers through the new Community Infrastructure Levy.</p>

<p><img src="http://affordable.herokuapp.com/images/fundinggap.png"></p>

<p>The hoped-for improvements include a new northern line ticket hall, better access to the mainline station, a remodelled northern roundabout, new leisure centre, GP surgeries and refurbished Town Hall with library and museum.</p>

<p>Evidently the money raised from developments at the Elephant so far has not been enough to provide all the benefits that everybody was expecting from the regeneration and so far committed public funding is not enough to fill the gap. This gap comprises a £40m shortfall for the northern line tube station upgrade, £12m needed for the mainline train station upgrade and about £9m needed for the northern roundabout improvements. The reason for the shortfalls is that developers are not paying enough. The CIL predecessor at the Elephant was the Elephant &amp; Castle Strategic Transport Tariff, which required developers to pay £175 per m2 of any new residential floorspace towards public transport infrastructure. The problem is that developers regularly submitted viability assessments showing that they couldn&rsquo;t afford to pay the full tariff. For example, Lend Lease was able to re-negotiate the tariff for its Heygate redevelopment down to a level of £104 per m2, providing a total transport contribution of £13m when it should have paid £22m:</p>

<p><a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/254761_1.pdf"><img src="/images/s106headsofterms.png"></a></p>

<p>In making up the shortfall, Southwark hopes to gain £18.5m in CIL contributions from future developments at the Elephant over the next 15 years, but this is obviously not enough and it could mean raiding CIL yields from elsewhere in the borough or CIL destined for health facilities, open space or public realm benefits.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/rbi-blogs/wp-content/blogs.dir/303/files/2014/06/the-blades-MoS.jpg"><img class="right" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/rbi-blogs/wp-content/blogs.dir/303/files/2014/06/the-blades-MoS.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a>The model of private development cross-subsidising public benefits is plainly not working. While public assets (eg. the disposal of public land or spending from public funds) is fuelling the regeneration, developers aren&rsquo;t paying enough towards the improvements. As we have <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2014/04/15/the-elephants-new-ivory-towers">shown</a> they systematically use viability assessments to wriggle out of planning contributions and all we are ending up with is social-housing free towers sprouting up across the Elephant (the latest proposed being the Ministry of Sound&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.estatesgazette.com/blogs/london-residential-research/2014/06/planning-battle-ministry-move/">&lsquo;the blades&rsquo;</a>).</p>

<h2>360 Tower PRS deal collapses</h2>

The latest news is that the groundbreaking plans for it to be one of the first large PRS - private rented sector developments in London have collapsed according to an <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2014/03/31/middlemen-on-the-make">article</a> in Property Week magazine. There is no information as to why this has happened - perhaps developers want a quicker return on their investment than PRS will provide? Delancey &amp; APG are also proposing a PRS development for the new shopping centre - will it go the same way? Maybe former deputy Council leader <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2013/12/07/kim-humphreys-exit-stage-left">turned development consultant</a> Kim Humphries knows?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Our <a href="/blog/2014/07/19/community-infrastructure-levy/">search</a> to identify mystery Objector 1301 - who is lobbying for subsidies to knock down Southwark&rsquo;s council estates at next week&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/856/planning_policy/2696/community_infrastructure_levy">CIL public inquiry</a> - has brought some clarity but also some more mystery with it.</p>

<p>Having been pointed towards Southwark Council&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/10738/cdcil5_appendix_i_of_regulation_19_consultation_statement">table of responses</a> to CIL objector representations, we noted that the Council&rsquo;s response to <strong>Objector 1301</strong>&rsquo;s objection makes it fairly clear who the objector is, but it also raises some worrying questions about the Aylesbury redevelopment and the Council&rsquo;s plan for the future of some of its housing estates in general.</p>

<p>In its response to <strong>Objector 1301</strong>, the Council makes the worrying admission that <strong> <em>&ldquo;The appraisal showed the [Aylesbury] site to be unviable with the requisite of providing 50% affordable housing.&rdquo;</em> </strong><a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/10738/cdcil5_appendix_i_of_regulation_19_consultation_statement">(pg 106)</a> and it then goes on to confirm that under the terms of the development agreement Notting Hill will be providing<strong> <em>&ldquo;affordable rented units&rdquo;.</em> </strong><a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/10738/cdcil5_appendix_i_of_regulation_19_consultation_statement">(pg 107)</a></p>

<p><a href="/images/zone3.png"><img class="right" src="/images/zone3.png" width="400" height="300"></a>But more worrying is the Council&rsquo;s response on page 109, where it states that it has <strong> <em>&ldquo;recommended a lower CIL rate in the lower value area of the Borough, within which the majority of housing estates identified for Estate renewal are located.&rdquo;</em> </strong><a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/10738/cdcil5_appendix_i_of_regulation_19_consultation_statement">(pg 109)</a>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<a href="/images/CILChargingZones.png"><img class="left" src="/images/CILChargingZones.png" width="400" height="800"></a>This estate renewal zone is shown as zone 3 in the map above. You can see from the map on the left that the Council&rsquo;s planners have split the borough into 3 zones for the puroposes of its CIL charging schedule. Zone 1 (bankside) will charge developers £400 per sqm for new residential buildings, zone 2 (the rest of the borough) will charge £200 per sqm, and developers in zone 3 - the <strong> <em>&lsquo;low value area&rsquo;</em> </strong>where <strong> <em>&lsquo;the majority of housing estate identified for renewal are located&rsquo;</em> </strong>- will be charged just £50 per sqm.</p>

<p></br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<a href="/images/MapSouthwarkEstates.png"><img class="right" src="/images/MapSouthwarkEstates.png" width="300" height="300"></a>Southwark&rsquo;s new estate renewal zone reaches right up to East Street, extends down to include most of Peckham and stretches from Rotherhithe in the East across to include most of the Brandon estate in the west. The map on the right illustrates that a significant proportion of the Council&rsquo;s housing stock is within the boundary of zone 3 and much of this comprises estates that haven&rsquo;t yet been brought up to Decent Homes standard.</p>

<p>No reference can be found in any other policy documents relating to this estate renewal zone. So is this a precursory indication of what could be found in the forthcoming replacement of the borough&rsquo;s Core Strategy? (which is as usual currently being drafted behind closed doors), or is it more an insight into Southwark&rsquo;s contradictory <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1617/southwark_council_challenges_mayor_over_affordable_rent">outwardly oppositional</a> but inwardly complicit stance towards controversial <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/eric-pickles-tear-down-estates-to-boost-poor-innercity-homes-9277330.html">government</a> and mayoral housing policy? In any case we would be interested to know if any council tenants or leaseholders in zone 3 have been notified that their estates have been <strong> <em>&ldquo;identified for estate renewal&rdquo;</em> </strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Delancey has been very shy about telling us what rents it will be charging for its new Private Rented Sector (PRS) homes in its <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7258">shopping centre</a> and <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7208">Tribeca Square</a> developments (which could total around 2000 units). We can now tell you: at least £375 per week for a 1-bed and £500 per week for a 2-bed flat; hardly rents that are <em>&ldquo;relevant to Londoners earning London wages&rdquo;</em> as Delancey has hitherto <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7378">maintained</a>. We know this because it is written in the evidence<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> submitted on behalf of Delancey by its representative Deloitte to next week&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/856/planning_policy/2696/community_infrastructure_levy">public inquiry</a> examining Southwark&rsquo;s new Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) charging schedules:</p>

<p><img src="/images/DelanceyCILSubmissionPRSRentLevels.png"></p>

<p>CIL is the amount a developer must pay towards public infrastructure and largely replaces the current s106 contributions. Developers don&rsquo;t like CIL because - unlike s106 - it is non-negotiable and they are now busy pleading poverty to try and get the CIL levy reduced. Delancey, joined by British Land, Berkeley homes, Sellar, Lend Lease etc. are claiming that the CIL tariffs proposed are a big threat to the viability of future projects and the delivery of affordable housing (not that the absence of affordable housing has worried them in the past!).</p>

<p>Delancey is also making an argument for reducing CIL in the particular case of Private Rented Sector developments, which is no surprise given the two sizeable PRS developments it has in its pipeline. Despite the eye-watering rents, it claims that it can&rsquo;t make as much money out of PRS as it would do if it were building private housing for sale. Added to this it has to wait longer to extract its customary 20% profit. Thankfully on this occasion Southwark Council appears to be standing its ground and rejects Delancey&rsquo;s argument<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/LBSResponseToCILSubmissions.png"></p>

<h3>Wanted: Objector 1301</h3>


<p><img class="left" src="/images/objector1301.jpg" width="300" height="200">As well as Delancey, Deloitte is representing several other developers at the inquiry, but none are as mysterious as <strong>Objector 1301</strong> whose identity is &lsquo;confidential&rsquo;<a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>. We are not surprised that objector 1301 wants to keep himself in the shadows, because his great idea is that anybody knocking down and redeveloping a council estate should not pay any CIL at all! <strong>Objector 1301</strong>&rsquo;s argument is that the cost of having to give ex-tenants and leaseholders fair compensation for losing their homes (although it is seldom fair) is too high to maintain the customary 20% profit, while also paying for local public infrastructure. <strong>Objector 1301</strong>&rsquo;s solution to the problem is simple and elegant - just insert a footnote saying that none of the above applies to council estate regenerations<a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/objector1301.png"></p>

<p>Who can this mystery <strong>Objector 1301</strong> be? Property developers have no qualms about being unpopular in their pursuit of profit, it is the nature of the beast. But a Housing Association may well feel the need to maintain its anonymity. Their free-market orientation is becoming more <a href="http://www.socialhousing.co.uk/free-preview-social-housings-2014-sales-and-development-activity-special-report/7004650.article">apparent</a> day by day, but Housing Associations must at least keep up the pretense of being affordable housing providers. If <strong>Objector 1301</strong> is a housing association could it possibly be one with extensive interests in Southwark? maybe one with the initials NHHT? We don&rsquo;t know for sure, but the 35% campaign is offering a small reward for any information that leads to the identification of this mystery objector.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/images/samkeilelephant.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/samkeilelephant.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a>Just when we thought the Heygate pyramid had set the limits on misconceived artistic collaborations at the Elephant, we got wind of the latest &lsquo;triumphant elephant&rsquo; sculpture proposal.
According to <a href="/images/samkeil_bio_2010.pdf">documents</a> posted on artist Sam Keil&rsquo;s website <em>&ldquo;the team responsible for the redevelopment of the Elephant and Castle district in South London have commissioned Sam to sculpt a major piece for a new public square&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p>The sculpture proposed on the site of the former Heygate estate football pitch is to comprise a bronze elephant <a href="https://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/keil_elephant.pdf"><em>&ldquo;standing on its hind legs on top of a tall castle tower, in the act of leaping into the air with its water-spraying trunk raised high in triumph.&rdquo;</em></a> The project also includes <a href="/images/samkeil_bio_2010.pdf"><em>&ldquo;a series of small elephants which will be distributed as bronze key rings to the owners of the many new apartments associated with the redevelopment.&rdquo;</em></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.vallico.net/sam/img/relief/2.jpg"><img class="right" src="http://www.vallico.net/sam/img/relief/2.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a>Sam has <a href="https://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/keil_elephant.pdf">published the full proposal</a> of the project on her website along with an example of her previous work at a St. John&rsquo;s Wood development, where - under the heading <em>&ldquo;The Effect of a Sam Keil Bronze on Property&rdquo;</em> - she claims that her sculptures enable developers to <em>&ldquo;charge whatever rent you like&rdquo;</em> . A letter from Southwark is also appended to her proposal in which Council bosses claim to be <em>&ldquo;very enthusiastic&rdquo;</em> about the idea, because it would be <em>&ldquo;well received locally&rdquo;</em> and that <em>&ldquo;the more elephants at the elephant the better!&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.vallico.net/sam/img/prince_philip.jpg" width="300" height="200">International artist Keil, seen here rubbing shoulders with Prince Philip, is represented by a <a href="http://www.whpatterson.com/">fine-art gallery</a> in Mayfair. Although Sam&rsquo;s husband claims that she got the commission <a href="http://www.barganews.com/blogs/towler/?p=37"><em>&ldquo;essentially because she knows one guy with connections&rdquo;</em></a> and that <a href="http://www.barganews.com/blogs/towler/?p=37"><em>&ldquo;not only can she sculpt, but she’s got a nice bottom&rdquo;</em></a>. Sam says that in her spare time she enjoys riding horses <a href="/images/samkeil_bio_2010.pdf"><em>&ldquo;bareback in the Arizona Badlands and also in the Negev desert in Israel&rdquo;</em></a>.</p>

<p>Sam <a href="http://www.vallico.net/sam/biography.html">works</a> from her studios in Cambridge and Tuscany and has delivered other high-profile sculptures during her career. In 2011 she <a href="http://www.vallico.net/sam/docs/ft.pdf">presented</a> a bronze eagle to former BP Chief Exec Lord Browne at the Royal Academy of Engineering. Her eagle is <a href="http://www.vallico.net/sam/docs/mike_towler_royal_academy.txt">claimed</a> to signify a <em>&ldquo;symbol of power&rdquo;</em> in manifesting the desire to make the <em>&ldquo;UK the King of Nations again&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p>Sam claims her bronze elephant <a href="/images/samkeil_bio_2010.pdf"><em>&ldquo;`Phoenix&#8217; with water soaring from his trunk will be a new twenty-first century update of the well-known elephant motif for the area&rdquo;</em></a>. We think it will be a tasteless and poorly thought-out marketing gimmick with little public value and a monument to how out-of-touch Southwark regen bosses are with local opinion.</p>

<h2>Kim Consulting (Limited)</h2>


<p><a href="https://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/photo-5-1.jpg"><img class="right" src="https://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/photo-5-1.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a>Delancey&rsquo;s long-promised consultation on the future of the shopping centre has finally begun. Ex-deputy Council Leader <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2013/12/07/kim-humphreys-exit-stage-left">turned development consultant</a> Kim Humphries, could be seen buttonholing unsuspecting shoppers last Friday to get their views on the redevelopment. One of the key questions being put is: <em>&ldquo;Do you think that the whole of the shopping centre site should be redeveloped rather than refurbished?“</em> This can only be rhetorical, because as our friends at <a href="http://southwarknotes.wordpress.com">Southwark Notes</a> point out - the decision to demolish the shopping centre has already been <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7378">taken</a> by Delancey. Southwark Council has also <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1368/council_will_insist_on_demolition_of_shopping_centre_at_elephant">decided</a> to &lsquo;insist&rsquo; on demolition of the centre.</p>

<p>At a recent Walworth Society meeting, Delancey said that it hopes to complete the consultation and submit a planning application by May 2014. They listed 94 community groups of different kinds that they said they will consult. One group omitted from the list were the shopkeepers. When challenged, Delancey insisted that shopkeepers&#8217; views would be taken fully into account, but that another team of Delancey operatives would be talking to the shopkeepers at the same time as re-negotiating their leases. We are sure this twin-track approach will not inhibit shopkeepers expressing their views. We hear that leases currently offered for renewal are limited to 5 years with a &lsquo;break clause&rsquo; in November 2016, which suggests that this might be the time that those who don&rsquo;t fit the profile of the new town centre will be leaving us.</p>

<p>Delancey is a private developer and a big one. It is registered in the British Virgin Islands and how Delancey turns this to good advantage has already been exposed in <a href="/images/PrivateEyeNo1311.pdf">Private Eye</a> and a Channel 4 Dispatches programme. It is <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/constructionandproperty/8606978/Minerva-deal-sees-Jamie-Ritblat-follow-in-fathers-property-footsteps.html">run</a> by Jamie Ritblat and funded by George Soros. Jamie is following in his dad&rsquo;s footsteps - former British Land chief executive Sir John Ritblat - and is a donor to the Tory party. He courted <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2041229/Tory-donor-Jamie-Ritblat-snaps-Olympic-Village-knock-price--costing-275m.html">controversy</a> in 2011 when he snapped up the Olympic Village at a knock down price of £557million – £275million less than the taxpayer paid <a href="http://www.thelondonmagazine.co.uk/property-experts/expert-opinions/the-olympic-village.html">bailing out</a> the previous owner - Lend Lease. Standing behind Jamie is the richest man in the world, George Soros. Mr Soros is notorious for nearly bankrupting the Bank of England and tipping the rest of us into poverty. Mr Soros claims to be <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-20-years-pound-erm">proud</a> of the fact the he made £1bn selling sterling that he didn&rsquo;t own. We obviously need have no fear about the future of the shopping centre development not being in good hands.</p>

<h3>Shopping Centre who&#8217;s who?</h3>


<p>The shopping centre was originally to be redeveloped by Lend Lease under the <a href="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf">Regeneration Agreement</a> signed in 2010 with Southwark Council. St Modwens (KPI) was the owner of the shopping centre at that time. A year later it signed an agreement with Southwark Council and another, tripartite agreement with both Southwark and Lend Lease for the redevelopment of the centre<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. These agreements have been kept confidential<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>. St Modwen then sold the site to Delancey &amp; funding partner APG in 2013. The question then, is what is the current contractual relationship between Southwark, Lend Lease and Delancey for the redevelopment of the shopping centre? It appears to be another instance where Southwark Council has several hats: development partner; public authority with CPO powers; author of enforcer of planning policy, and as former Heygate residents know it does not always resolve these competing roles in the best interests of local people.</p>

<h2>Save the Coronet</h2>


<p><img class="left" src="http://crackmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-shot-2013-12-03-at-14.55.50-660x403.png" width="300" height="200">The Coronet is taking no chances with its future, it has launched the <a href="http://coronettheatre.co.uk/home/save-the-coronet/">&lsquo;Save the Coronet&rsquo;</a> campaign and has gained impressive support from a long list of <a href="/images/SNSaveTheCoronet.pdf">distinguished artists</a> who have performed there. A sizeable part of the shopping centre site is occupied by the Coronet - a music and event venue, it has also been a cinema and music hall <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7701">dating back to 1872</a> and is a popular local institution.</p>

<h2>Trading Places</h2>


<p>Welcome to &lsquo;Social Life&rsquo; -a social enterprise based on the Pullens estate. Funded by the Young Foundation, their mission is <em>&ldquo;to reconnect placemaking with people&rsquo;s everyday experience and the way that communities work.&rdquo;</em> They have turned their attention to the Elephant &amp; Castle and the impact of the regeneration on local people. The say this: <em>&ldquo;we are carrying out an independent research project to understand how traders in the Elephant &amp; Castle Shopping Centre are being affected by the proposed regeneration. We want to understand how the proposed changes are affecting people now and how they will impact on traders and customers and their businesses, livelihoods, friendships and local relationships in the future. We want to understand more about the Shopping Centre’s social value.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The results of the research which will be made available in a number of ways: a short report, which will be available on Social Life’s website; a local exhibition of stories and photographs; and a festival about social change being organised by the Social Innovation Exchange. The research findings will be available in September 2014.

In Britain homeowners don&rsquo;t have that option - sooner or later they would have to accept whatever is offered, as the leaseholders on Southwark&rsquo;s Aylesbury estate are finding out.</p>

<p>Last week Southwark Council served a Compulsory Purchase Order on 22 leaseholders, 12 secure tenants and 8 non-secure tenants whose homes are to be demolished in the next phase of the Aylesbury redevelopment. We reported briefly last year on the <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/SNWolverton.pdf">elderly</a> residents <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/ObjectionCPOAugust2012.pdf">objecting</a> to the <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/WolvertonCPO.pdf">Compulsory Purchase</a> of their homes during the previous phase of the scheme and how they were subsequently <a href="/blog/2014/05/30/aylesbury-leaseholder-fights-incestuous-valuation/">forced into litigation</a> in order to obtain fair compensation for their homes.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/pictures/643xAny/2/6/5/18265_Regen_Aylesbury_032.jpg" width="300" height="200">The Council&rsquo;s justification for the CPO - its <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/AylesburyPhase3CPO.pdf">Statement of Reasons</a> for making the order is full of the usual arguments: &ldquo;the Aylesbury estate is amongst the most deprived areas in England&rdquo;; &ldquo;the built fabric is dated&rdquo;; &ldquo;it goes against good design principles&rdquo;; &ldquo;elements of its layout such as the raised walkways contribute to crime&rdquo;.
Many of these arguments can be contested, for example the 2005 Council-commissioned structural survey declared the buildings sound and Southwark&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/200179/aylesbury_estate/2686/aylesbury_development_partnership/2">own admission</a> that the estate&rsquo;s crime rate is 45% below the borough average. Even if the Council&rsquo;s arguments are accepted it doesn&rsquo;t justify the Council&rsquo;s use of Compulsory Purchase powers against these residents.</p>

<p>One difference between this CPO and that of the Heygate is that it has been served not just on leaseholders but also on council tenants. The Heygate&rsquo;s 1,000 tenants were instead removed from the estate under the Landlord &amp; Tenant Act with the help of 198 Notices to Quit and 4 eventual evictions. Whatever the procedure used, the Council is obliged to make secure tenants an offer of alternative accommodation. Non-secure tenants aren&rsquo;t so lucky: under the Aylesbury CPO there is no guarantee of any offer at all.</p>

<p>Leaseholders will have to rely on their compensation to buy a new home in the area. We know from the two cases that recently went to the Lands Tribunal that this is woefully inadequate with offers of just £85k for a 1-bed and £165k for a 4-bed flat. While current leaseholders are being offered a pittance, 2-bed new-build flats in the <a href="http://www.burgessterrace.co.uk/">completed phase 1</a> Aylesbury development are being <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/s/v02kjcryf8ni15r/LandRegistryTitleTGL392009.pdf">sold for £490,000</a>.</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand this when Southwark should be getting plenty of money from the sale of 28.5 hectares of prime central London real estate. It got £20m for the sale of its nearby Manor Place development site to Notting Hill Housing (£11.8m per Hectare); on this comparison the Aylesbury site could be worth a staggering £330m.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.albany-place.co.uk/"><img class="left" src="http://www.ruskinwalk.co.uk/images/common/ruskin-walk-brochure.jpg"></a>Aylesbury leaseholders are being offered shared ownership options on the nearby Elmington estate regeneration, but this is on very unfavourable terms as shown by <a href="http://moderngov.southwarksites.com/documents/s45196/Representation%20from%20Aylesbury%20Leaseholders%20Action%20Group.pdf">submissions</a> from leaseholders to the Council&rsquo;s recent Overview and Scrutiny Committee meeting.</p>

<p>Aylesbury Leaseholders have formed themselves into an action group and have released <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vjtwnow85uwfta0/AylesburyCPOPressStatement4July2014v3.pdf">this press statement</a> in their fight to get a fair deal. They have objected to the CPO and there is likely to be a public inquiry.</p>
