  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://tradingplaces-elephant.tumblr.com/"><img class="right" src="http://33.media.tumblr.com/eb768bd9c749502c3d8926ced246593f/tumblr_nbcjwdMLuv1tklzg2o1_1280.jpg" width="200" height="300"></a>We <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/07/12/the-more-rent-seeking-elephants-at-elephant-the-better/">blogged</a> on 12th July about <a href="http://www.social-life.co/blog/post/Trading_Places_Elephant_and_Castle_regen/"><em>Social Life</em></a>, a social enterprise based on the Pullens estate. They have now completed their research on the Elephant &amp; Castle shopping centre redevelopment and how it is affecting the traders there. A concise and impressive report is now available <a href="http://tradingplaces-elephant.tumblr.com/">here</a>. Its conclusions will not surprise people familiar with the shopping centre. It says: <em>&ldquo;Overall, traders are anxious and concerned about the redvelopment. Many of the traders have mixed feelings about the plans.&rdquo;</em>;<em>&ldquo;The shopping centre is an important social space for traders, local people and regular customers and it plays a hugely important role in the social life of the local community.&rdquo;</em>;<em>&ldquo;The shopping centre supports dense networks of social relationships in the local area, across London and globally.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>We hope developers Delancey have read this report and are giving it full weight in their forthcoming planning application for the shopping centre&rsquo;s redevelopment. However, we hear from several sources that they are not treating the current occupants very well: rents are being raised and new rental agreements are in the form of licences rather than leases, which points towards them getting rid of shopkeepers rather than keeping them. An <a href="http://www.theprisma.co.uk/2014/09/21/how-changes-in-elephant-castle-will-affect-the-latino-community/">interview</a> with respected academic and Director of <a href="http://latinelephant.wordpress.com/">Latin Elephant</a> Patria Roman paints a similar picture. Nevertheless, one shopping centre leaseholder and popular venue for Latin American events appears to be fighting back - the <a href="https://www.change.org/p/southwark-council-save-the-coronet">&lsquo;Save the Coronet&rsquo; petition</a> now stands at 3,856 signatures.</p>

<h2>Sorting Office sorted?</h2>


<p><img class="left" src="http://walworthsociety.co.uk/images/Copy%20of%20image%20001%20-%20resized.jpg" width="300" height="150">Two contentious planning applications are pending just down the road from the Elephant in Walworth. One of these would see the effective demolition of a local heritage asset - the former sorting office on Penrose street, the other could jeopardise the future of much loved and valued local mental health charity <em>Cooltan Arts</em>.</p>

<p>The Sorting Office was built in 1897 and the Walworth Society has long been <a href="http://walworthsociety.co.uk/index.php/blog/116-31-penrose-street-walworths-victorian-sorting-office">campaigning</a> to have it retained as part of the extensive redevelopment of the area. A previous planning application was refused after a large number of objections to its demolition. Its owner is now back with <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeDocs&amp;TheSystemkey=9554889">another application</a> which looks like a prime example of &lsquo;facadism&rsquo;: an increasingly common practice which has been <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/aug/25/front-facade-bad-developments-ruining-historic-buildings">described</a> in the development industry as a <em>&ldquo;wilful two fingers up&rdquo;</em> to local planners.</p>

<p>The application is for 6 x 3 storey and 2 x 2 storey town houses, 8 being just below Southwark&rsquo;s threshold for an affordable housing contribution. They will be squeezed behind the retained facade and side wall, but require the demolition of the rest of the sorting office and surrounding outbuildings.</p>

<h2>Cooltan Arts - threat</h2>


<p><img class="right" src="http://www.cooltanarts.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSCF4054-lr.jpg" width="300" height="200">Cooltan Arts, long term residents of the Walworth road were relocated last year on the <a href="http://www.cooltanarts.org.uk/2013/10/cooltan-arts-community-space-for-237-walworth-road/">promise</a> that they would be able to return to redveloped premises on their former site off the Walworth road. But a revised planning application for the site no longer contains this promise to reprovide space for Cooltan (nor does it contain the amount of affordable housing required by policy). Objections to the application <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeResultDetail&amp;TheSystemkey=9553921">ref:(14/AP/0830)</a> can still be sent to <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;&#112;&#108;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x6e;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#x2e;&#x61;&#112;&#x70;&#108;&#105;&#x63;&#97;&#116;&#105;&#111;&#x6e;&#115;&#x40;&#115;&#x6f;&#117;&#116;&#104;&#119;&#x61;&#x72;&#107;&#x2e;&#x67;&#x6f;&#x76;&#x2e;&#117;&#x6b;&#x2e;">&#x70;&#x6c;&#x61;&#110;&#x6e;&#105;&#110;&#x67;&#46;&#97;&#x70;&#112;&#x6c;&#105;&#99;&#97;&#116;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#115;&#x40;&#115;&#x6f;&#117;&#116;&#104;&#x77;&#97;&#114;&#107;&#x2e;&#x67;&#111;&#x76;&#46;&#117;&#x6b;&#x2e;</a></p>

<h2>Developers award Southwark top marks</h2>


<p>Southwark Council has been <a href="http://www.mipimuk-awards.co.uk/mipimukawards2014/shortlist">shortlisted</a> for two awards at the latest property developers&#8217; jamboree <strong>&lsquo;MIPIM UK&rsquo;</strong>, due to be held at Kensington Olympia on 15th-17th October. Southwark is in the running to be both <em>&ldquo;UK best planning authority of the year&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;Public-Private Partnership of the Year&rdquo;</em> for the Aylesbury estate. The MIPIM awards <a href="http://www.mipimuk-awards.co.uk/mipimukawards2014/shortlist">web page</a> claims that for developers, Southwark is both <em>&ldquo;welcoming and demanding&rdquo;</em>. We agree that it is certainly welcoming but as we have shown, it is not so demanding - especially when it comes to enforcing its own minimum policies on affordable housing contributions.</p>

<p>MIPIM also states in the citation for the Aylesbury partnership award that 75% of its affordable housing will be social rented. We doubt very much that all the new social rented homes will be at social rents and suspect that the forthcoming Aylesbury outline planning application will replace at least some of it with the new so-called &lsquo;affordable rents&#8217;of up to 80% market rent.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/peter-j-mipim.jpg?w=500&h=409" width="375" height="375">MIPIM itself is usually held in sunny <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6687">Cannes</a>. In 2013 the Council leader was <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/SNCannesMipim.pdf">accused</a> of <em>&lsquo;going on a jolly&rsquo;</em> to the event paid for by developer Lend Lease and last year he <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7449">withdrew</a> after protests and demonstrations. This year it is proving equally controversial: several Councils have pulled out after media pressure and an <a href="http://southwarknotes.wordpress.com/2014/09/21/open-letter-to-southwark-council-to-not-attend-mipim/">open letter</a> signed by several local campaign groups asks Southwark to join them. So far Council leader Peter John is unimpressed.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://radicalhousingnetwork.org/">Radical Housing Network</a> is organising protests during the exhibiton on 15th - 17th October.</p>

<h2>Heygate viability assessment latest</h2>


<p>After a long appeal against the Information Commisioner&rsquo;s decision, the Information Tribunal ordered Southwark Council and Lend Lease to disclose the Heygate viability assessment back in May. The Tribunal extended the time for forwarding the assessment to the Information Commissioner back in June, but the assessment has still not been revealed. After inquiries to the Tribunal by Mr Glasspool who requested the information, a case management hearing has now been scheduled for 15th October.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Southwark Council has had its feathers ruffled by both the Guardian and the BBC lately. A <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/17/truth-property-developers-builders-exploit-planning-cities">Guardian article</a> by Oliver Wainright uses the redevelopment of the Heygate estate as an example of how developers are <em>&lsquo;exploiting planning authorities and ruining our cities&rsquo;</em>.</p>

<p>Southwark Council has posted a <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1785/setting_the_record_straight_the_true_value_of_the_elephant_and_castle_regeneration">press statement</a> <strong>&lsquo;setting the record straight&rsquo;</strong>, in which it claims it will receive <em>&ldquo;phased payments as the scheme progresses&rdquo;</em> and this will amount to <em>&ldquo;hundreds of millions&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf"><img class="center" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/HeygateLandReceipts.png"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf"><img class="right" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/rapage70.png" width="400" height="620"></a>It is true that there will be phased payments amounting to £50m (£46m for the main site + £4m for the Rodney road site) - this figure is now well known from the leaked <a href="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf">Regeneration Agreement</a>, but getting the <em>&ldquo;hundreds of millions&rdquo;</em> of pounds depends upon the so-called &lsquo;overage&rsquo; or &lsquo;super-profit&rsquo; and how much this will be, if anything, won&rsquo;t be known until the project is completed in 2025.</p>

<p>The overage will be what is left over after building costs, a 2.6% management fee and 20% priority developer return is deducted from the total sales revenue and it will be calculated according to Lend Lease&rsquo;s financial model, as detailed in a 3000 page spreadsheet known as Appendix 22 of the Heygate viability assessment. This complicated accounting process is entirely under Lend Lease&rsquo;s control and while the Council has the right to inspect the financial model, this may not guarantee the expected overage windfall as the Barangaroo Delivery Authority in Sydney Australia <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/barangaroo-public-works-in-doubt-after-government-loses-court-battle-with-lend-lease-20140821-106lke.html">is finding out</a> to its cost.</p>

<p>Any reckoning of the gain due to Southwark must also take into account the £65m<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> it has spent on Heygate decant costs plus an unquantified amount of public money devoted to regeneration since the wider E&amp;C scheme was conceived, starting with the £25m Single Regeneration Budget (SRB) funding received back in 1999.</p>

<p>On top of the Guardian’s Heygate story the BBC has taken up the plight of Aylesbury leaseholders being &lsquo;forced out of the city&rsquo;, with an <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-29098960">online article</a> and televised reports on both its London News and <a href="http://youtu.be/RtvghCKNJjQ">Inside Out programme</a> on 8th Sep. Inside Out did not think much of the paltry amount of compensation leaseholders on the Aylesbury estate were being offered, particularly in comparison to the £340k cost of one-bed properties in the area and described the situation as <em>&lsquo;the Right to Buy dream turned sour&rsquo;</em>.</p>

<p>Southwark again &lsquo;sets the record straight&rsquo; and <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1767/southwark_councils_full_response_to_bbc_inside_out_programme">insists</a> that offers such as <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/05/16/southwark-gives-green-light-to-slum-landlords/">£85k for a 1-bed flat</a> are based on <em>&ldquo;actual market evidence of properties being sold on the Aylesbury estate&rdquo;</em>. This method of basing valuations on the sales prices of other properties depressed by the prospect of demolition has been <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/05/30/aylesbury-leaseholder-fights-incestuous-valuation/">criticised</a> by the Lands Tribunal. Southwark Council&rsquo;s valuers are also pretty imaginative in the way they gather &lsquo;market evidence&rsquo;, using a <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/05/16/southwark-gives-green-light-to-slum-landlords/">1-bed property which had been illegally converted</a> to 4 beds flat as the basis of the compensation for one unfortunate leaseholder.  The derisory compensation offered to Aylesbury leaseholders is in stark contrast to the abundant profit that the builder of the Aylesbury redevelopment Barratt has just <a href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-2750592/Booming-UK-housing-market-fuels-doubling-annual-profits-Barratt.html">announced</a>.</p>

<p>The Guardian and BBC stories reflect a wide-spread public view that developers and housebuilders are making big profits at local people’s expense and taking Southwark for a ride (an <a href="https://www.change.org/p/heygate-estate-scandal-demand-an-investigation">online petition</a> demanding an investigation into the Heygate development has gained over 700 signatures in 3 days) and a couple of press releases from Southwark won’t change this view.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Notting Hill Housing Trust is an important provider of housing in Southwark, both &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; and <a href="http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,26531,440,00.htm">private</a>. It has plans to build more than 4000 homes in Southwark; 3500 of these will be on the Aylesbury estate, which it is redeveloping <a href="http://www.nottinghillhousing.org.uk/about-us/building-new-homes/our-developments/aylesbury-estate-southwark">in partnership</a> with Britain&rsquo;s largest - and the mayor&rsquo;s favourite - housebuilder Barratt Homes. According to the NHHT <a href="http://www.nottinghillhousing.org.uk/asset/view/6912.pdf">website</a>, a hybrid application comprising outline planning for the whole Aylesbury and detailed planning for the first phase is due to be submitted by the NHHT/Barratt consortium next month.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/development/greater-london-authority-allocates-404m-for-affordable-homes/7004790.article"><img class="left" src="http://35percent.org/images/nottinghillfunding.png" width="400" height="300"></a>Notting Hill has secured more money than any other housing association from the Mayor&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/housing-land/increasing-housing-supply/affordable-homes-programme">affordable housing fund</a> (£59m - nearly three times the amount of the next highest provider). However, it is <a href="http://www.cih.org/news-article/display/vpathDCR/templatedata/cih/news-article/data/Losing_social_homes_means_we_are_storing_up_trouble">well known</a> that a condition of getting money from this funding stream is that only affordable rented homes can be built - not social rented. This was <a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk//7005104.article">cited</a> by London Labour housing spokesperson Tom Copley as the reason why so few housing associations had applied for the funding, of which £380m still remains unallocated.</p>

<p>Notting Hill Housing Trust enthusiastically <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2014/06/16/notting-hill-housing-no-social-housing">endorses</a> the Mayor&rsquo;s affordable rent policies, which may explain why Boris Johnson is so happy to give it so much money.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://35percent.org/images/SouthwarkMarketRents.png">Aylesbury estate tenants will have the right to a tenancy in the new Notting Hill development and those already &lsquo;decanted&rsquo; to other parts of the borough will have the right to return, but if the affordable rents are 80% of market rent this won&rsquo;t mean very much. Southwark Council&rsquo;s recently published &lsquo;Affordable Rent Product Study&rsquo; gives £289pw as the market rent of a 1-bed flat in SE17 – 80% of this would be £231pw.  A council rent for a 1-bed flat in SE17 is currently around £100pw.</p>

<p>Southwark Council has repeatedly said in public that there would be 50% affordable housing on the new Aylesbury, of which 75% would be social rented and this was written into its <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/200211/area_action_plans/1327/aylesbury_area_action_plan">planning policy for the scheme</a>. Notting Hill Housing Trust now says that social rent is the same as affordable rent and probably thinks that people are too stupid to tell the difference.</p>

<p>We think that any Aylesbury tenant moving into one of the replacement homes should not be expected to pay much more than their current council rent. If Southwark doesn&rsquo;t want to see another Heygate-style diaspora of long-standing communities then it should hold good on its promises, stick to its policies and ensure that policy definitions are not allowed to be blurred.</p>

<h2>Notting Hill Housing Trust - Manor Place Depot</h2>


<p><img class="left" src="http://35percent.org/images/manorplace.jpg" width="300" height="200">We <a href="http://affordable.heroku.com/blog/2014/06/16/notting-hill-housing-no-social-housing/">blogged</a> in June about the prospect of no social housing in Notting Hill Housing&rsquo;s Manor Place Depot development. Since then NHHT appears to have had a change of heart.</p>

<p>One of our members visited NHHT&rsquo;s second exhibition for its Manor Place Depot development and reported back as follows:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The exhibition gave no figures for the housing , simply saying some of the housing would be affordable rent, of which social rent was as a subset.  However discussions with NHHT staff yielded the following information:</em></p>

<p><em>The 35% target for affordable housing would be met, with 95 units out of the 270 proposed.  Of these 95 units, 50% will be affordable rent and 50% shared ownership.  NHHT defines affordable rent as including social rent, and there will be some social rent though they don&rsquo;t know how much until the viability assessment.  NHHT policy, they say, is for all the family units to be at social rent.</em></p>

<p><em>Since the first exhibition, NHHT has received GLA funds for all of its sites.  This contributes £30,000 - £40,000 of the cost per unit, they say.  NHHG were unwilling to provide information as to what exact tenure mix this public funding will subsidise, and how it differs per site.</em></p>

<p><em>On affordable market rent, NHHT say they don&rsquo;t go anywhere near 80% market rent and have a cap in London of £230 (i.e. this is the maximum affordable market rent they will charge, they say).</em></p>

<p><em>They said that there will be a further exhibition in September/October ahead of the planning application in November/December.&ldquo;</em></p>

<h4>We say:</h4>


<p>Social rented housing and affordable rented housing are not one and the same thing, Notting Hill Housing Trust needs to stop muddying the waters. If it wants to start consulting meaningfully with local people it must tell them exactly how much social rented housing there will be and how much affordable rented housing there will be and exactly how much rent they will be charging for each.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A £64m funding gap for the infrastructure improvements of the Elephant &amp; Castle regeneration has been identified by Southwark Council. The figure is given in its <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/10740/addendum_to_cdeip1">submission</a> to the Government inspector examining Southwark&rsquo;s plans for raising funds from developers through the new Community Infrastructure Levy.</p>

<p><img src="http://affordable.herokuapp.com/images/fundinggap.png"></p>

<p>The hoped-for improvements include a new northern line ticket hall, better access to the mainline station, a remodelled northern roundabout, new leisure centre, GP surgeries and refurbished Town Hall with library and museum.</p>

<p>Evidently the money raised from developments at the Elephant so far has not been enough to provide all the benefits that everybody was expecting from the regeneration and so far committed public funding is not enough to fill the gap. This gap comprises a £40m shortfall for the northern line tube station upgrade, £12m needed for the mainline train station upgrade and about £9m needed for the northern roundabout improvements. The reason for the shortfalls is that developers are not paying enough. The CIL predecessor at the Elephant was the Elephant &amp; Castle Strategic Transport Tariff, which required developers to pay £175 per m2 of any new residential floorspace towards public transport infrastructure. The problem is that developers regularly submitted viability assessments showing that they couldn&rsquo;t afford to pay the full tariff. For example, Lend Lease was able to re-negotiate the tariff for its Heygate redevelopment down to a level of £104 per m2, providing a total transport contribution of £13m when it should have paid £22m:</p>

<p><a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/254761_1.pdf"><img src="/images/s106headsofterms.png"></a></p>

<p>In making up the shortfall, Southwark hopes to gain £18.5m in CIL contributions from future developments at the Elephant over the next 15 years, but this is obviously not enough and it could mean raiding CIL yields from elsewhere in the borough or CIL destined for health facilities, open space or public realm benefits.</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/rbi-blogs/wp-content/blogs.dir/303/files/2014/06/the-blades-MoS.jpg"><img class="right" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/rbi-blogs/wp-content/blogs.dir/303/files/2014/06/the-blades-MoS.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a>The model of private development cross-subsidising public benefits is plainly not working. While public assets (eg. the disposal of public land or spending from public funds) is fuelling the regeneration, developers aren&rsquo;t paying enough towards the improvements. As we have <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2014/04/15/the-elephants-new-ivory-towers">shown</a> they systematically use viability assessments to wriggle out of planning contributions and all we are ending up with is social-housing free towers sprouting up across the Elephant (the latest proposed being the Ministry of Sound&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.estatesgazette.com/blogs/london-residential-research/2014/06/planning-battle-ministry-move/">&lsquo;the blades&rsquo;</a>).</p>

<h2>360 Tower PRS deal collapses</h2>


<p><img class="left" src="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/1299150006_80.177.117.97.jpg" width="300" height="200">We <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2014/03/31/middlemen-on-the-make">blogged</a> earlier in the year about Elephant tower of shame the &lsquo;London 360 Tower&rsquo;. The latest news is that the groundbreaking plans for it to be one of the first large PRS - private rented sector developments in London have collapsed according to an <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2014/03/31/middlemen-on-the-make">article</a> in Property Week magazine. There is no information as to why this has happened - perhaps developers want a quicker return on their investment than PRS will provide? Delancey &amp; APG are also proposing a PRS development for the new shopping centre - will it go the same way? Maybe former deputy Council leader <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2013/12/07/kim-humphreys-exit-stage-left">turned development consultant</a> Kim Humphries knows?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Our <a href="/blog/2014/07/19/community-infrastructure-levy/">search</a> to identify mystery Objector 1301 - who is lobbying for subsidies to knock down Southwark&rsquo;s council estates at next week&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/856/planning_policy/2696/community_infrastructure_levy">CIL public inquiry</a> - has brought some clarity but also some more mystery with it.</p>

<p>Having been pointed towards Southwark Council&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/10738/cdcil5_appendix_i_of_regulation_19_consultation_statement">table of responses</a> to CIL objector representations, we noted that the Council&rsquo;s response to <strong>Objector 1301</strong>&rsquo;s objection makes it fairly clear who the objector is, but it also raises some worrying questions about the Aylesbury redevelopment and the Council&rsquo;s plan for the future of some of its housing estates in general.</p>

<p>In its response to <strong>Objector 1301</strong>, the Council makes the worrying admission that <strong> <em>&ldquo;The appraisal showed the [Aylesbury] site to be unviable with the requisite of providing 50% affordable housing.&rdquo;</em> </strong><a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/10738/cdcil5_appendix_i_of_regulation_19_consultation_statement">(pg 106)</a> and it then goes on to confirm that under the terms of the development agreement Notting Hill will be providing<strong> <em>&ldquo;affordable rented units&rdquo;.</em> </strong><a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/10738/cdcil5_appendix_i_of_regulation_19_consultation_statement">(pg 107)</a></p>

<p><a href="/images/zone3.png"><img class="right" src="/images/zone3.png" width="400" height="300"></a>But more worrying is the Council&rsquo;s response on page 109, where it states that it has <strong> <em>&ldquo;recommended a lower CIL rate in the lower value area of the Borough, within which the majority of housing estates identified for Estate renewal are located.&rdquo;</em> </strong><a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/10738/cdcil5_appendix_i_of_regulation_19_consultation_statement">(pg 109)</a>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<a href="/images/CILChargingZones.png"><img class="left" src="/images/CILChargingZones.png" width="400" height="800"></a>This estate renewal zone is shown as zone 3 in the map above. You can see from the map on the left that the Council&rsquo;s planners have split the borough into 3 zones for the puroposes of its CIL charging schedule. Zone 1 (bankside) will charge developers £400 per sqm for new residential buildings, zone 2 (the rest of the borough) will charge £200 per sqm, and developers in zone 3 - the <strong> <em>&lsquo;low value area&rsquo;</em> </strong>where <strong> <em>&lsquo;the majority of housing estate identified for renewal are located&rsquo;</em> </strong>- will be charged just £50 per sqm.</p>

<p></br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<a href="/images/MapSouthwarkEstates.png"><img class="right" src="/images/MapSouthwarkEstates.png" width="300" height="300"></a>Southwark&rsquo;s new estate renewal zone reaches right up to East Street, extends down to include most of Peckham and stretches from Rotherhithe in the East across to include most of the Brandon estate in the west. The map on the right illustrates that a significant proportion of the Council&rsquo;s housing stock is within the boundary of zone 3 and much of this comprises estates that haven&rsquo;t yet been brought up to Decent Homes standard.</p>

<p>No reference can be found in any other policy documents relating to this estate renewal zone. So is this a precursory indication of what could be found in the forthcoming replacement of the borough&rsquo;s Core Strategy? (which is as usual currently being drafted behind closed doors), or is it more an insight into Southwark&rsquo;s contradictory <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1617/southwark_council_challenges_mayor_over_affordable_rent">outwardly oppositional</a> but inwardly complicit stance towards controversial <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/eric-pickles-tear-down-estates-to-boost-poor-innercity-homes-9277330.html">government</a> and mayoral housing policy? In any case we would be interested to know if any council tenants or leaseholders in zone 3 have been notified that their estates have been <strong> <em>&ldquo;identified for estate renewal&rdquo;</em> </strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Delancey has been very shy about telling us what rents it will be charging for its new Private Rented Sector (PRS) homes in its <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7258">shopping centre</a> and <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7208">Tribeca Square</a> developments (which could total around 2000 units). We can now tell you: at least £375 per week for a 1-bed and £500 per week for a 2-bed flat; hardly rents that are <em>&ldquo;relevant to Londoners earning London wages&rdquo;</em> as Delancey has hitherto <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7378">maintained</a>. We know this because it is written in the evidence<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> submitted on behalf of Delancey by its representative Deloitte to next week&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/856/planning_policy/2696/community_infrastructure_levy">public inquiry</a> examining Southwark&rsquo;s new Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) charging schedules:</p>

<p><img src="/images/DelanceyCILSubmissionPRSRentLevels.png"></p>

<p>CIL is the amount a developer must pay towards public infrastructure and largely replaces the current s106 contributions. Developers don&rsquo;t like CIL because - unlike s106 - it is non-negotiable and they are now busy pleading poverty to try and get the CIL levy reduced. Delancey, joined by British Land, Berkeley homes, Sellar, Lend Lease etc. are claiming that the CIL tariffs proposed are a big threat to the viability of future projects and the delivery of affordable housing (not that the absence of affordable housing has worried them in the past!).</p>

<p>Delancey is also making an argument for reducing CIL in the particular case of Private Rented Sector developments, which is no surprise given the two sizeable PRS developments it has in its pipeline. Despite the eye-watering rents, it claims that it can&rsquo;t make as much money out of PRS as it would do if it were building private housing for sale. Added to this it has to wait longer to extract its customary 20% profit. Thankfully on this occasion Southwark Council appears to be standing its ground and rejects Delancey&rsquo;s argument<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/LBSResponseToCILSubmissions.png"></p>

<h3>Wanted: Objector 1301</h3>


<p><img class="left" src="/images/objector1301.jpg" width="300" height="200">As well as Delancey, Deloitte is representing several other developers at the inquiry, but none are as mysterious as <strong>Objector 1301</strong> whose identity is &lsquo;confidential&rsquo;<a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>. We are not surprised that objector 1301 wants to keep himself in the shadows, because his great idea is that anybody knocking down and redeveloping a council estate should not pay any CIL at all! <strong>Objector 1301</strong>&rsquo;s argument is that the cost of having to give ex-tenants and leaseholders fair compensation for losing their homes (although it is seldom fair) is too high to maintain the customary 20% profit, while also paying for local public infrastructure. <strong>Objector 1301</strong>&rsquo;s solution to the problem is simple and elegant - just insert a footnote saying that none of the above applies to council estate regenerations<a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/objector1301.png"></p>

<p>Who can this mystery <strong>Objector 1301</strong> be? Property developers have no qualms about being unpopular in their pursuit of profit, it is the nature of the beast. But a Housing Association may well feel the need to maintain its anonymity. Their free-market orientation is becoming more <a href="http://www.socialhousing.co.uk/free-preview-social-housings-2014-sales-and-development-activity-special-report/7004650.article">apparent</a> day by day, but Housing Associations must at least keep up the pretense of being affordable housing providers. If <strong>Objector 1301</strong> is a housing association could it possibly be one with extensive interests in Southwark? maybe one with the initials NHHT? We don&rsquo;t know for sure, but the 35% campaign is offering a small reward for any information that leads to the identification of this mystery objector.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/images/samkeilelephant.jpg"><img class="left" src="/images/samkeilelephant.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a>Just when we thought the Heygate pyramid had set the limits on misconceived artistic collaborations at the Elephant, we got wind of the latest &lsquo;triumphant elephant&rsquo; sculpture proposal.
According to <a href="/images/samkeil_bio_2010.pdf">documents</a> posted on artist Sam Keil&rsquo;s website <em>&ldquo;the team responsible for the redevelopment of the Elephant and Castle district in South London have commissioned Sam to sculpt a major piece for a new public square&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p>The sculpture proposed on the site of the former Heygate estate football pitch is to comprise a bronze elephant <a href="https://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/keil_elephant.pdf"><em>&ldquo;standing on its hind legs on top of a tall castle tower, in the act of leaping into the air with its water-spraying trunk raised high in triumph.&rdquo;</em></a> The project also includes <a href="/images/samkeil_bio_2010.pdf"><em>&ldquo;a series of small elephants which will be distributed as bronze key rings to the owners of the many new apartments associated with the redevelopment.&rdquo;</em></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.vallico.net/sam/img/relief/2.jpg"><img class="right" src="http://www.vallico.net/sam/img/relief/2.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a>Sam has <a href="https://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/keil_elephant.pdf">published the full proposal</a> of the project on her website along with an example of her previous work at a St. John&rsquo;s Wood development, where - under the heading <em>&ldquo;The Effect of a Sam Keil Bronze on Property&rdquo;</em> - she claims that her sculptures enable developers to <em>&ldquo;charge whatever rent you like&rdquo;</em> . A letter from Southwark is also appended to her proposal in which Council bosses claim to be <em>&ldquo;very enthusiastic&rdquo;</em> about the idea, because it would be <em>&ldquo;well received locally&rdquo;</em> and that <em>&ldquo;the more elephants at the elephant the better!&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.vallico.net/sam/img/prince_philip.jpg" width="300" height="200">International artist Keil, seen here rubbing shoulders with Prince Philip, is represented by a <a href="http://www.whpatterson.com/">fine-art gallery</a> in Mayfair. Although Sam&rsquo;s husband claims that she got the commission <a href="http://www.barganews.com/blogs/towler/?p=37"><em>&ldquo;essentially because she knows one guy with connections&rdquo;</em></a> and that <a href="http://www.barganews.com/blogs/towler/?p=37"><em>&ldquo;not only can she sculpt, but she’s got a nice bottom&rdquo;</em></a>. Sam says that in her spare time she enjoys riding horses <a href="/images/samkeil_bio_2010.pdf"><em>&ldquo;bareback in the Arizona Badlands and also in the Negev desert in Israel&rdquo;</em></a>.</p>

<p>Sam <a href="http://www.vallico.net/sam/biography.html">works</a> from her studios in Cambridge and Tuscany and has delivered other high-profile sculptures during her career. In 2011 she <a href="http://www.vallico.net/sam/docs/ft.pdf">presented</a> a bronze eagle to former BP Chief Exec Lord Browne at the Royal Academy of Engineering. Her eagle is <a href="http://www.vallico.net/sam/docs/mike_towler_royal_academy.txt">claimed</a> to signify a <em>&ldquo;symbol of power&rdquo;</em> in manifesting the desire to make the <em>&ldquo;UK the King of Nations again&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p>Sam claims her bronze elephant <a href="/images/samkeil_bio_2010.pdf"><em>&ldquo;`Phoenix&#8217; with water soaring from his trunk will be a new twenty-first century update of the well-known elephant motif for the area&rdquo;</em></a>. We think it will be a tasteless and poorly thought-out marketing gimmick with little public value and a monument to how out-of-touch Southwark regen bosses are with local opinion.</p>

<h2>Kim Consulting (Limited)</h2>


<p><a href="https://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/photo-5-1.jpg"><img class="right" src="https://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/photo-5-1.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a>Delancey&rsquo;s long-promised consultation on the future of the shopping centre has finally begun. Ex-deputy Council Leader <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2013/12/07/kim-humphreys-exit-stage-left">turned development consultant</a> Kim Humphries, could be seen buttonholing unsuspecting shoppers last Friday to get their views on the redevelopment. One of the key questions being put is: <em>&ldquo;Do you think that the whole of the shopping centre site should be redeveloped rather than refurbished?“</em> This can only be rhetorical, because as our friends at <a href="http://southwarknotes.wordpress.com">Southwark Notes</a> point out - the decision to demolish the shopping centre has already been <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7378">taken</a> by Delancey. Southwark Council has also <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1368/council_will_insist_on_demolition_of_shopping_centre_at_elephant">decided</a> to &lsquo;insist&rsquo; on demolition of the centre.</p>

<p>At a recent Walworth Society meeting, Delancey said that it hopes to complete the consultation and submit a planning application by May 2014. They listed 94 community groups of different kinds that they said they will consult. One group omitted from the list were the shopkeepers. When challenged, Delancey insisted that shopkeepers&#8217; views would be taken fully into account, but that another team of Delancey operatives would be talking to the shopkeepers at the same time as re-negotiating their leases. We are sure this twin-track approach will not inhibit shopkeepers expressing their views. We hear that leases currently offered for renewal are limited to 5 years with a &lsquo;break clause&rsquo; in November 2016, which suggests that this might be the time that those who don&rsquo;t fit the profile of the new town centre will be leaving us.</p>

<p>Delancey is a private developer and a big one. It is registered in the British Virgin Islands and how Delancey turns this to good advantage has already been exposed in <a href="/images/PrivateEyeNo1311.pdf">Private Eye</a> and a Channel 4 Dispatches programme. It is <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/constructionandproperty/8606978/Minerva-deal-sees-Jamie-Ritblat-follow-in-fathers-property-footsteps.html">run</a> by Jamie Ritblat and funded by George Soros. Jamie is following in his dad&rsquo;s footsteps - former British Land chief executive Sir John Ritblat - and is a donor to the Tory party. He courted <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2041229/Tory-donor-Jamie-Ritblat-snaps-Olympic-Village-knock-price--costing-275m.html">controversy</a> in 2011 when he snapped up the Olympic Village at a knock down price of £557million – £275million less than the taxpayer paid <a href="http://www.thelondonmagazine.co.uk/property-experts/expert-opinions/the-olympic-village.html">bailing out</a> the previous owner - Lend Lease. Standing behind Jamie is the richest man in the world, George Soros. Mr Soros is notorious for nearly bankrupting the Bank of England and tipping the rest of us into poverty. Mr Soros claims to be <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-20-years-pound-erm">proud</a> of the fact the he made £1bn selling sterling that he didn&rsquo;t own. We obviously need have no fear about the future of the shopping centre development not being in good hands.</p>

<h3>Shopping Centre who&#8217;s who?</h3>


<p>The shopping centre was originally to be redeveloped by Lend Lease under the <a href="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf">Regeneration Agreement</a> signed in 2010 with Southwark Council. St Modwens (KPI) was the owner of the shopping centre at that time. A year later it signed an agreement with Southwark Council and another, tripartite agreement with both Southwark and Lend Lease for the redevelopment of the centre<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. These agreements have been kept confidential<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>. St Modwen then sold the site to Delancey &amp; funding partner APG in 2013. The question then, is what is the current contractual relationship between Southwark, Lend Lease and Delancey for the redevelopment of the shopping centre? It appears to be another instance where Southwark Council has several hats: development partner; public authority with CPO powers; author of enforcer of planning policy, and as former Heygate residents know it does not always resolve these competing roles in the best interests of local people.</p>

<h2>Save the Coronet</h2>


<p><img class="left" src="http://crackmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-shot-2013-12-03-at-14.55.50-660x403.png" width="300" height="200">The Coronet is taking no chances with its future, it has launched the <a href="http://coronettheatre.co.uk/home/save-the-coronet/">&lsquo;Save the Coronet&rsquo;</a> campaign and has gained impressive support from a long list of <a href="/images/SNSaveTheCoronet.pdf">distinguished artists</a> who have performed there. A sizeable part of the shopping centre site is occupied by the Coronet - a music and event venue, it has also been a cinema and music hall <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7701">dating back to 1872</a> and is a popular local institution.</p>

<h2>Trading Places</h2>


<p>Welcome to &lsquo;Social Life&rsquo; -a social enterprise based on the Pullens estate. Funded by the Young Foundation, their mission is <em>&ldquo;to reconnect placemaking with people&rsquo;s everyday experience and the way that communities work.&rdquo;</em> They have turned their attention to the Elephant &amp; Castle and the impact of the regeneration on local people. The say this: <em>&ldquo;we are carrying out an independent research project to understand how traders in the Elephant &amp; Castle Shopping Centre are being affected by the proposed regeneration. We want to understand how the proposed changes are affecting people now and how they will impact on traders and customers and their businesses, livelihoods, friendships and local relationships in the future. We want to understand more about the Shopping Centre’s social value.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The results of the research which will be made available in a number of ways: a short report, which will be available on Social Life’s website; a local exhibition of stories and photographs; and a festival about social change being organised by the Social Innovation Exchange.

In Britain homeowners don&rsquo;t have that option - sooner or later they would have to accept whatever is offered, as the leaseholders on Southwark&rsquo;s Aylesbury estate are finding out.</p>

<p>Last week Southwark Council served a Compulsory Purchase Order on 22 leaseholders, 12 secure tenants and 8 non-secure tenants whose homes are to be demolished in the next phase of the Aylesbury redevelopment. We reported briefly last year on the <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/SNWolverton.pdf">elderly</a> residents <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/ObjectionCPOAugust2012.pdf">objecting</a> to the <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/WolvertonCPO.pdf">Compulsory Purchase</a> of their homes during the previous phase of the scheme and how they were subsequently <a href="/blog/2014/05/30/aylesbury-leaseholder-fights-incestuous-valuation/">forced into litigation</a> in order to obtain fair compensation for their homes.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/pictures/643xAny/2/6/5/18265_Regen_Aylesbury_032.jpg" width="300" height="200">The Council&rsquo;s justification for the CPO - its <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/AylesburyPhase3CPO.pdf">Statement of Reasons</a> for making the order is full of the usual arguments: &ldquo;the Aylesbury estate is amongst the most deprived areas in England&rdquo;; &ldquo;the built fabric is dated&rdquo;; &ldquo;it goes against good design principles&rdquo;; &ldquo;elements of its layout such as the raised walkways contribute to crime&rdquo;.
Many of these arguments can be contested, for example the 2005 Council-commissioned structural survey declared the buildings sound and Southwark&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/200179/aylesbury_estate/2686/aylesbury_development_partnership/2">own admission</a> that the estate&rsquo;s crime rate is 45% below the borough average. Even if the Council&rsquo;s arguments are accepted it doesn&rsquo;t justify the Council&rsquo;s use of Compulsory Purchase powers against these residents.</p>

<p>One difference between this CPO and that of the Heygate is that it has been served not just on leaseholders but also on council tenants. The Heygate&rsquo;s 1,000 tenants were instead removed from the estate under the Landlord &amp; Tenant Act with the help of 198 Notices to Quit and 4 eventual evictions. Whatever the procedure used, the Council is obliged to make secure tenants an offer of alternative accommodation. Non-secure tenants aren&rsquo;t so lucky: under the Aylesbury CPO there is no guarantee of any offer at all.</p>

<p>Leaseholders will have to rely on their compensation to buy a new home in the area. We know from the two cases that recently went to the Lands Tribunal that this is woefully inadequate with offers of just £85k for a 1-bed and £165k for a 4-bed flat. While current leaseholders are being offered a pittance, 2-bed new-build flats in the <a href="http://www.burgessterrace.co.uk/">completed phase 1</a> Aylesbury development are being <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/s/v02kjcryf8ni15r/LandRegistryTitleTGL392009.pdf">sold for £490,000</a>.</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand this when Southwark should be getting plenty of money from the sale of 28.5 hectares of prime central London real estate. It got £20m for the sale of its nearby Manor Place development site to Notting Hill Housing (£11.8m per Hectare); on this comparison the Aylesbury site could be worth a staggering £330m.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.albany-place.co.uk/"><img class="left" src="http://www.ruskinwalk.co.uk/images/common/ruskin-walk-brochure.jpg"></a>Aylesbury leaseholders are being offered shared ownership options on the nearby Elmington estate regeneration, but this is on very unfavourable terms as shown by <a href="http://moderngov.southwarksites.com/documents/s45196/Representation%20from%20Aylesbury%20Leaseholders%20Action%20Group.pdf">submissions</a> from leaseholders to the Council&rsquo;s recent Overview and Scrutiny Committee meeting.</p>

<p>Aylesbury Leaseholders have formed themselves into an action group and have released <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vjtwnow85uwfta0/AylesburyCPOPressStatement4July2014v3.pdf">this press statement</a> in their fight to get a fair deal. They have objected to the CPO and there is likely to be a public inquiry.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/images/buildings/en/471/471093-18941-800.jpg" width="300" height="200">One of the most characterful development sites within the the Elephant and Castle Opportunity Area is the <a href="http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/elephant-and-castle-home/elephant-and-castle-history/00,news,10016,5757,00.htm">Manor Place Baths</a>.  The baths provided laundry and bathing facilities to Walworth people for 80 years, until demolition of the surrounding streets and the removal of the local population to the Heygate and Ayelsbury estates sounded its death knell in the 80’s; it was replaced as a swimming pool by the Elephant &amp; Castle leisure centre, the baths were filled in by Southwark Council in 1998 and the buildings were then used by the Council&rsquo;s Environmental Services department until their relocation in 2012.</p>

<p>Notting Hill Housing Trust (NHHT) purchased the 1.7 hectare site from the Council in Nov 2013 for the reasonable sum of £20m - reasonable compared to the <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/elephant-and-castle-estate-revamp-ripped-off-taxpayers-8482794.html">£50m figure</a> it sold the 9.9 Hectare Heygate site for. NHHT is now putting out feelers to local community groups in anticipation of a planning application before the end of the year.   The omens do not look good.</p>

<p><a href="/images/manorplace.jpg"><img class="right" src="/images/manorplace.jpg" width="370" height="240"></a> First, rather than deal directly with the local community NHTT have engaged M&amp;N Place to do the work for them.  M&amp;N Place is eminently qualified – it has an <a href="http://www.mnplace.co.uk/contact-us/">office in Abu Dhabi</a>, provides <a href="http://www.mnplace.co.uk/case-studies/pre-planning/">&lsquo;political intelligence&rsquo;</a> about local authorities and is well versed in bending local opinion to the developers will on behalf of London boroughs. M&amp;N Place is also eminently <a href="http://www.mnplace.co.uk/case-studies/pre-planning/kidbrooke-greenwich/">experienced</a> - having successfully bent opinion for Berkeley homes&#8217; <a href="http://halag.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/ferrier.pdf">deplorable redevelopment</a> of the Ferrier estate in Greenwich.</p>

<p>Undeterred, a concerned local resident attended the first <a href="http://manorplacedepot.co.uk/manor-place-banners.pdf">public exhibition</a> for the development. There was no information about affordable housing on display, but after probing NHHT staff it turns out there will be no social housing - we will be getting the dreaded affordable rent instead. They agreed this would be beyond the means of people on low or average incomes. <a href="/images/manorplacedepotconsultation.pdf">Here</a> is a link to his full report.</p>

<p>NHHT are shy about saying what exactly the rents will be, but below is a screenshot taken <a href="http://www.nottinghillhousing.org.uk/customers/permanent-rented-housing/information-for-permanent-rented-housing-tenants/affordable-rent-update">from its website</a> which gives us some idea what to expect:</p>

<p><img src="/images/nhhtrents.png"></p>

<h3>Housing contradictions</h3>


<p>Some housing associations have <a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/affordable-rent-not-worth-the-risk-say-associations/6513502.article">complained</a> about the introduction of affordable rent, but NHHT is a true believer: as reported in Labour&rsquo;s <a href="http://redbrickblog.wordpress.com/2014/06/04/what-are-housing-associations-for-part-4/">redbrick blog</a> &lsquo;NHHT chief Kate Davies chaired the ‘Housing and Dependency Working Group’ of Iain Duncan Smith’s think tank the Centre for Social Justice. The name of the group almost says it all, but her conclusion is: ‘social housing is not a desirable destination; private ownership is preferable to state provided solutions’.</p>

<p>NHHT&rsquo;s hostility to social housing is evident in its <a href="http://www.nottinghillhousing.org.uk/customers/permanent-rented-housing/information-for-permanent-rented-housing-tenants/affordable-rent-update">conversion policy</a> - social rented homes will be converted to affordable rent as soon as there is a change of tenant.</p>

<p>NHHT will be providing 1,200 of Southwark&rsquo;s new homes over the next three years in Camberwell, Peckham, Bermondsey &amp; Blackfriars plus the 3,500 new homes on the Aylesbury estate. In a <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2014/05/05/manx-connections-the-off-shore-home-of-the-elephants-developers">previous blog</a> we raised concerns about exactly what kind of affordable housing the Aylesbury estate would get. As the picture becomes clearer that concern deepens. Up to now Southwark has fought the very idea of introducing affordable rent to the borough, joining with seven other boroughs in <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1387/councils_to_take_mayor_of_london_to_court_over_affordable_rents">taking Boris Johnson to court</a>. Former head of regeneration Cllr Fiona Colley <a href="/images/fionacolleyresponsetolondonplan.pdf">summed up</a> the matter simply: <em>&lsquo;affordable rent will be very difficult for people in housing need to afford&rsquo;</em>. So why is NHHT - the champion of affordable rent - providing so many of Southwark&rsquo;s new homes?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="http://cached.imagescaler.hbpl.co.uk/resize/scaleWidth/456/?sURL=http://offlinehbpl.hbpl.co.uk/News/NST/charity-Tribunal-20140514044354391.jpg" width="250" height="140">As reported in our previous blog post, this week saw a second Aylesbury leaseholder fighting the council&rsquo;s controversial compensation valuations at the Upper Lands Tribunal. In buying back homes on the estate the Council has consistently maintained that all leaseholders are given &lsquo;market value&rsquo; in compensation for the loss of their homes. Last week <a href="/blog/2014/05/16/southwark-gives-green-light-to-slum-landlords/">we learned</a> how it arrives at its market value calculation by using illegaly-converted flats as comparable market evidence. This week we learned more about its valuation procedures.</p>

<p>The claimant was a Mrs Olubunmi John, formerly of 28 Wolverton on the Aylesbury estate and now living in the Kent borders. She was represented by <a href="http://www.averyassociatessurveyors.com/">Avery Associates</a> chartered surveyors and a barrister from <a href="http://www.tanfieldchambers.co.uk/Barristers/Stan_Gallagher">Tanfield Chambers</a>. Mrs John&rsquo;s surveyor had originally carried out a survey and valued her 3-storey, 4-bed maisonette at £288,750. In adjusting for market conditions he increased this to £297,500 on the date she and her family had to leave. The council&rsquo;s valuation of Mrs John&rsquo;s home on the day it took possession was just £165,000.</p>

<p>The hearing began with Mrs John&rsquo;s representatives producing a council-commissioned report confirming that the buildings were structurally sound. This quickly defeated earlier unevidenced intimations by the council that the Aylesbury estate&rsquo;s buildings had structural issues.</p>

<p>The barrister then questioned the impartiality of the Southwark council officer who decided on the compensation offer. He pointed out that other boroughs use an independent valuer - somebody from outside the council to decide how much the property is worth. The compensation is then based upon this objective valuation. Southwark Council keep it all &lsquo;in house&rsquo;: they decide their own valuation and then offer that amount as compensation. Most other London Boroughs - <a href="http://sutton.moderngov.co.uk/Data/Strategy%20Committee/20040608/Agenda/$Item%2016.doc.pdf">Sutton</a>,  <a href="http://bit.ly/1pqMVho">Kensington &amp; Chelsea</a>, <a href="http://www.newham.gov.uk/Documents/Environment%20and%20planning/Carpenters%20Estate%20Residents%20Charter.pdf">Newham</a>,
<a href="http://debeauvoircouncillors.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/colville-estate-regeneration-what-is.html">Hackney</a> and Lewisham to name just a few - all rely on valuations from independent external valuers as the basis for their negotiations.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8345/8183341508_e809f1b36f_z.jpg" width="300" height="200">Mrs John&rsquo;s barrister also criticised Southwark Council for using other properties on the Aylesbury also earmarked for demolition as its basis for compensation. He referred to Greenwich Council doing just this on the <a href="http://halag.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/ferrier.pdf">Ferrier estate</a> regeneration in Kidbrooke. The Tribunal there rejected the practice as &lsquo;incestuous&rsquo; when it heard an appeal from a Ferrier leaseholder in 2007 and ordered the use of properties off the estate to be used as comparables when calculating compensation.</p>

<p>The barrister went on to claim that the Council was undervaluing properties on the Aylesbury and that this was demonstrated by the high returns that buy-to-let investors were making on the estate. He showed evidence that the properties were averaging a 13% yield - more than double the current average return on investment for properties in London which stands at around 6%. Using the London average figure and average rents on the Aylesbury to calculate the market value of Mrs John&rsquo;s home gives a figure of around £300,000 - nearly double the council&rsquo;s offer. But even this amount is unlikely to buy her a new home in the swanky new <a href="http://www.albany-place.co.uk">Harvard Gardens</a> - the development replacing her Aylesbury home.</p>

<p>The Lands Tribunal should be there to protect people like Mrs John and her neighbours, including the 130 or so <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/SNWolverton.pdf">elderly leaseholders</a> left on the estate, but the risk of taking on Southwark Council and losing is too high and Southwark Council is taking full of advantage of the fact. One of the first things the new labour administration must do is start offering the estate&rsquo;s leaseholders decent and fair compensation for the loss of their homes.</p>

<h2>Meet the &#8216;pop-up&#8217; neighbours</h2>


<p><a href="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/elephant-rd-park-2008.jpg"><img class="right" src="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/elephant-rd-park-2008.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a>On Thursday this week the new <a href="http://www.theartworks-uk.com/">Heygate pop-up boxpark</a> was showcasing its container units to prospective tenants. The event was marketed on the <a href="http://shoreditch.hypeapp.co/shared-events/14034/">&lsquo;Shoreditch Hype&rsquo;</a> website inviting <em>&lsquo;designer-maker&rsquo;</em> or creative businesses to <em>&lsquo;head south for Pop-ups&rsquo;</em> bringing the East London vibe to the Elephant. Prospective tenants were <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/824753570885436/">invited</a> to come and <em>&lsquo;meet the neighbours&rsquo;</em> at the nearly completed container boxpark located the former Elephant Park - formerly designated public open space until its <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2012/07/04/londons-largest-new-private-park-in-70-years">controversial enclosure</a> in 2012.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BouMpuWIAAApjKT.png" width="300" height="200">Among the <a href="http://blog.wearepopup.com/p/viewing-at-the-artworks/">&lsquo;neighbours&rsquo;</a> already booked to move into the boxpark - when it is completed at the end of June - are two pop-up fashion boutiques, a massage and yoga <a href="http://signup.body-align.co.uk/">&lsquo;vitality hub&rsquo;</a>, a Mauritian tearoom where <em>&lsquo;Artists and designers will showcase their products within Qubes that form the walls&rsquo;</em> and a <a href="http://www.southeastcakery.com/">pop-up &lsquo;Brownie Bar&rsquo;</a>. There will be another open day for prospective designer makers and creative businesses on Weds 4th June.</p>

<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>


<h3>The People&#8217;s Bureau</h3>

<p>The aim of the People&rsquo;s Bureau is to create a pool of collective local knowledge through exchange, a supporting network of different skills and to draw attention to the diversity and existence of different economies in the Elephant and Castle.</p>

<p>For more information about the project, please go to their <a href="http://peoplesbureau.tumblr.com/">website.</a></p>

<h3>Doing the Walworth Walk</h3>


<p><a href="http://www.peoplesrepublicofsouthwark.co.uk/images/stories/news/30may201405.PNG"><img class="left" src="http://www.peoplesrepublicofsouthwark.co.uk/images/stories/news/30may201405.PNG" width="300" height="200"></a>Walworth Society and Friends of Burgess Park have joined forces to host a series of free events on Saturday 7th June, under the <em>&lsquo;Walworth Heritage Day&rsquo;</em> umbrella.
The day will kick off with two guided walks around Walworth. The walks (first at 09:30, second one at 10:00) start at La Bodeguita (South American restaurant at the north end of Walworth Road) will criss-cross Walworth Road until they finish at St Peter&rsquo;s Church in Liverpool Grove, approximately two hours later.</p>

<p>From 11:00 - 15:00, St Peter&rsquo;s Church will host the exhibition of the Walworth heritage and an event by Creation Trust:</p>

<p><strong>This is Walworth</strong>, by the Walworth Society, is an exhibition of panoramas of all the shops and historic buildings that make up the Walworth Road and see how it has changed over the past 100 years.</p>

<p><strong>&lsquo;Put it on the map&rsquo;</strong>, by the council-led <a href="http://www.creationtrust.org/">Creation Trust</a> - you will be invited to tell your stories of the area at the Listening Post, see old images of Walworth from Southwark&rsquo;s Local History Library and Archive collection and suggest names of the new streets, blocks and open spaces at <a href="http://www.rightmove.co.uk/developer/branch/Lend-Lease/Elephant-Park-108524.html">Elephant Park</a> (or, as many local people with memory still prefer to call it, the former Heygate estate).</p>

<p>Free refreshments will be provided by the Electric Elephant Cafe at Inspire.</p>
