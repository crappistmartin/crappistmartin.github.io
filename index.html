  <div class="entry-content"><p>We <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/10/04/lets-talk-about-peters-promises/">wrote</a> in October about the council&rsquo;s plan to earmark a number of its housing estates for demolition using an <a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Snhat.pdf">&lsquo;Asset Performance Evaluation Tool&rsquo;</a>, which would take into account factors like residents&#8217; income. The results of its survey were supposed to be presented at next week&rsquo;s Cabinet meeting, but the <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s50476/Report%20Pipeline%20for%20the%20Delivery%20of%201500%20New%20Council%20Homes.pdf">December Cabinet report</a> shows that this has now been postponed until January.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s50476/Report%20Pipeline%20for%20the%20Delivery%20of%201500%20New%20Council%20Homes.pdf">December Cabinet report</a> makes interesting reading: it concedes that its estate renewal programme alone may not provide enough capacity for its 11,000 proposed new &lsquo;council&rsquo; homes and suggests two additional strategies:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Buying affordable housing built through s106 agreements directly from developers. (see <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s50476/Report%20Pipeline%20for%20the%20Delivery%20of%201500%20New%20Council%20Homes.pdf">para. 58</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Purchasing land that becomes available on the open market. (see <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s50476/Report%20Pipeline%20for%20the%20Delivery%20of%201500%20New%20Council%20Homes.pdf">para. 60</a>)</p></li>
</ol>


<p>We can see two obvious problems with these new strategies:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Southwark&rsquo;s track record on securing affordable housing through s106 obligations is extremely poor. The viability assessment loophole means that developers often get away with building no affordable housing whatsoever. In those cases where affordable housing is provided, it normally takes the form of shared ownership and affordable rent (80% market), which are of little benefit unless these are the kind of &lsquo;council&rsquo; homes that Southwark is looking to provide.</p></li>
<li><p>We have already <a href="http://35percent.org/heygate-regeneration-faq/">reported</a> on Southwark&rsquo;s loss on the sale of its 25-acre Heygate site at a knock-down price to developer Lend Lease. We don&rsquo;t know how much it sold the Aylesbury for, but we think it&rsquo;s unlikely to recover the estimated £150m cost<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> of demolishing the 60-acre estate. So it doesn&rsquo;t need us to point out the absurdity of selling off structurally-sound council estates on the cheap and then buying back land from the private sector in order to build new &lsquo;council&rsquo; homes.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s50478/Appendix%202%20Direct%20Delivery%20Sites.pdf"><img class="right" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/DirectDeliverySites.png" width="400" height="750"></a>The December Cabinet report also provided an update on the council&rsquo;s progress with its 11,000 new &lsquo;council&rsquo; homes &lsquo;Direct Delivery&rsquo; programme. Phase one of the programme involving the &lsquo;delivery&rsquo; of 1,500 new &lsquo;council&rsquo; homes by 2018 is now being finalised, with sites for 837 of these new &lsquo;council&rsquo; homes now identified. <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s50478/Appendix%202%20Direct%20Delivery%20Sites.pdf">Appendix 2</a> of the report gives a detailed schedule of these 837 new &lsquo;council&rsquo; homes and where they are to be located.</p>

<p>However, a closer look at the schedule reveals that many of these won&rsquo;t be council homes and that some are being funded by selling off existing stock. For example, the first two entries on the list are supposedly providing 27 new council homes on the East Dulwich estate (Gatebeck House:9 &amp; Southdown House:18). But it doesn&rsquo;t say that a third of these will be for shared ownership<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>; neither does it mention that these 27 new &lsquo;council&rsquo; homes on the East Dulwich estate, are being funded by selling off land and 50 existing council homes on other parts of the estate: <em>&ldquo;with £2.2m to be raised from the sale of 24 drying room conversions; £8.76m from the sale of 50 voids-for-sale and £4.1m to be raised from the disposal of land&rdquo;</em>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>The next entry on the Direct Delivery schedule is Willow Walk near Old Kent Road, which is supposedly providing 75 new &lsquo;council&rsquo; homes. However, according to paragraphs 5 &amp; 6 of the <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/284022_1.pdf">planning report</a> for this development, the 75 units comprise only 21 social rented homes, plus 54 rooms for temporary accommodation (replacing the existing temporary accommodation unit) - very welcome no doubt but not 75 council homes.</p>

<p>Next on the schedule is the site of the former Nunhead Community Centre, which is supposedly providing 8 new &lsquo;council&rsquo; homes. What it doesn&rsquo;t mention is that a large (1000 sqm) council-owned community centre is being demolished to make way for these and that the 8 new council homes will be <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/304415_1.pdf">accompanied</a> by 14 new homes for private sale.</p>

<p>Another council-owned community centre and some workshops are being demolished in Sumner road, Peckham. The schedule says that this site will provide 112 new &lsquo;council&rsquo; homes. What it doesn&rsquo;t say is that less than half of these (50) will be social-rented; 20 will be shared ownership and the remaining 42 units will be &lsquo;council&rsquo; homes for private sale. (see <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeDocs&amp;TheSystemkey=9555190">planning docs</a>)</p>

<p>Of the 25 new &lsquo;council&rsquo; homes built on the former Masterman House garages in Camberwell, only 15 will be social rented; the remainder will also be &lsquo;council&rsquo; homes for private sale. Just 34 of the 116 new &lsquo;council&rsquo; homes planned for Commmercial Way will be social rented and so the list goes on. We can&rsquo;t find details for many of the sites listed in the schedule, but we estimate that only around half of the 837 new &lsquo;council&rsquo; homes listed will be &lsquo;council&rsquo; homes as we know them. The remainder will be shared ownership and &lsquo;council&rsquo; homes for private sale, which doesn&rsquo;t come as a surprise in the wake of the revelations stemming from <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/10/18/southwark-mipim-and-the-11000-new-council-homes/">our reporting</a> of Southwark&rsquo;s MIPIM attendance this year.</p>

<h2>Footing the bill of regeneration</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1713650/thumbs/o-ELEPHANT-AND-CASTLE-STATION-facebook.jpg" width="300" height="175">The <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5293">long-running dispute</a> over who should pay for the capacity upgrades to the northern line tube station in order to meet increased demand from developments, has finally come to an end. Southwark News <a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/SNroundabout.pdf">reports</a> that of the £154m total cost, TFL have agreed to pay £91m while the council is left to find the remaining £63m. The council&rsquo;s regeneration partner Lend Lease is making a contribution of just £16.3m<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> towards the council&rsquo;s bill - proof that the regeneration partnership is not an equal one, with Southwark bearing the lion&rsquo;s share of costs and Lend Lease reaping the Elephantine profits.</p>

<h2>Untrustworthy imagery</h2>

<p>Lend Lease got a <a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/private_eye.jpg">mention</a> in the latest edition of Private Eye. This time for a development in Chiswick, where its PR firm have been accused of producing misleading imagery. The column also pointed out that Paul Dimoldenberg, the head of Lend Lease&rsquo;s PR firm which created the images, also happens to be leader of the Labour group at Westminster council. We can add that Cllr Dimoldenberg also used to be a senior council officer at Southwark.</p>

<p>Our hats go off to Mr Dimoldenberg&rsquo;s firm for its PR image trickery. The following is a visualisation image from the Heygate application. <br/>
<img src="http://www.elephantandcastle-lendlease.com/wp-content/uploads/Homepage-Header-2-Not-sure-if-this-size-image-will-work1.jpg"></p>

<p>Looks nice doesn&rsquo;t it? but what the image doesn&rsquo;t tell you is that this is one of the developments&#8217; 12 &lsquo;raised courtyards&rsquo;, which are enclosed by buildings and will have zero public access:<br/>
<a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/267119_1.pdf"><img src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/heygate_raised_courtyards2.png"></a></p>

<h2>Coronet uncorrugated</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/store/ttdb/ttt0048/lowres/010997_regular.jpg?1410824878" width="300" height="600">New photographs have been <a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/SNcoronet.pdf">published</a> showing what the Art Deco Coronet building looks like behind its corrugated blue facade. <br/>
The Coronet is currently under threat of demolition from the shopping centre redevelopment. The shopping centre and neighbouring site are being redeveloped by real estate hedge fund DV4. George Soros backed DV4 is based in the British Virgin Islands and managed by <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2041229/Tory-donor-Jamie-Ritblat-snaps-Olympic-Village-knock-price--costing-275m.html">Delancey&rsquo;s Jamie Ritblatt</a>.</p>

<p>The Theatres Trust has recently submitted an application to have the Coronet listed. You can read more about the campaign on the <a href="http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/theatres/show/3344-coronet-london">Theatres Trust website</a>, the Save the Coronet campaign <a href="http://coronettheatre.co.uk/home/save-the-coronet/">web page</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2014/dec/07/how-the-coronet-can-help-the-elephant">this article</a> by the Guardian&rsquo;s Dave Hill. <br/>
</br></p>

<h2>Unfair trial</h2>

<p>After being unlawfully evicted from his home, having his possessions destroyed and being left street homeless by Southwark council, a Sudanese refugee <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/judge-blasts-southwark-council-for-evicting-sudanese-tenant-and-destroying-his-possessions-9796994.html">won</a> a long-running court case against the council in October. After spending six-figure sums on top QCs to fight the case against the claimaint (who had no legal representation), the council declared last week that the trial was &lsquo;unfair&rsquo; and &lsquo;clearly wrong&rsquo;. An <a href="http://nearlylegal.co.uk/blog/2014/11/southwark-not-appealing/">article</a> about the case by the Giles Peaker, a partner specialising in housing at solicitors Anthony Gold, sums up Southwark&rsquo;s attitude well: <em>&ldquo;disingenuous in the extreme&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<h2>Heygate viability assessment FOI/EIR appeal</h2>

<p>The ongoing battle to disclose the Heygate development viability assessment continues. The Information Tribunal has called a final hearing on 21st January to resolve the ongoing dispute concerning the implementation of its <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/FirstTierDecisionHeygate.pdf">May 2014 decision notice</a>. The hearing will be in closed session attended only by Lend Lease &amp; Southwark&rsquo;s counsel, who will recieve directions as to exactly which of the 22 appendices can be withheld. The Tribunal had previously ruled that the financial model in appendix 22 and the figures related to commercial negotiations for its retail floorspace could be withheld, but there has been a dispute over exactly which of the 22 appendices are related to these. We are expecting the Tribunal to order the viability assessment be disclosed within a short period after the hearing (barring further appeals and heeldragging by Lend Lease &amp; Southwark). After nearly 3 years of battling for its disclosure we are looking forward to finally being able to see why Lend Lease has been so reluctant to show its sums.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/pagenotfound.png" width="300" height="200">The planning documents for the Aylesbury estate outline masterplan have been <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeDocs&amp;TheSystemkey=9557153">removed</a> from Southwark council&rsquo;s planning portal. The documents for the first development site under the masterplan have also been <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeDocs&amp;TheSystemkey=9557152">removed</a>. The applications were <a href="http://35percent.org/images/scan0027.pdf">lodged</a> on 25th September and the documents uploaded about a month later. On inquiry, Southwark said that the applications had been <em>&ldquo;uploaded in error, they are currently invalid and not open to consultation.&rdquo;</em> It also said that <em>&ldquo;as soon as the relevant documentation has been received .. and been made valid they will be posted on the website&rdquo;</em>. It is not clear whether the applications have been withdrawn and now need to be re-submitted. Our <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/11/01/aylesbury-estate-planning-application/">previous blog</a> on the Aylesbury applications pointed out - amongst other things - that 934 social rented homes are to be lost if the development goes ahead as planned.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Aylesbury leaseholders are fighting to get a fair deal from the council and its development partners Notting Hill Housing &amp; Barratt Homes. A leaseholders&#8217; <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s50093/Report%20Deputation%20Requests.pdf">deputation</a> will be submitting <a href="https://halag.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/alag_depuation18nov_finalversion.pdf">5 demands</a> to the council&rsquo;s Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Amongst their very sensible requirements is one that any council officer who values their homes is actually qualified to do so, as it turns out this is not always the case: a leaseholder&rsquo;s complaint to the recognised professional body (RICS) could not be dealt with because the officers concerned were not RICS qualified or registered. The leaseholders have requested instead that valuations are conducted by the District Valuer Service.</p>

<p>At the same meeting, Southwark will also be receiving a deputation from the <a href="http://www.sgto.org.uk/">Southwark Group of Tenants Organisation</a>, who also have some <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s49943/Appendix%206%20Six%20alternative%20pledges%20from%20SGTO.pdf">suggestions</a>, this time about improving the six pledges Southwark has made for conducting its consultation on building 11,000 new council homes. Southwark should adopt these improved pledges, it will be a step in the right direction, but it is also <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/11/08/southwark-fails-to-deliver/">clear</a> that the Council already has definite ideas about how these new homes will be provided, including estate regeneration and estate infill.</p>

<h2>Head in the clouds</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/betterelephant/status/531882170424786944"><img class="left" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/tweet.png" width="400" height="800"></a>Southwark&rsquo;s Head of Regeneration Councillor Mark Williams, obviously got a bit giddy last week at the topping out ceremony of Lend Lease&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.onetheelephant.com/apartments/browse-apartments"><strong>One the Elephant</strong></a> tower (or maybe Lend Lease plied him with too much champagne). He <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/01/11/flogging-the-elephant/">tweeted</a> from the rooftop ceremony about the wonderful view as well as the <em>&ldquo;new homes, jobs and leisure centre for local residents&rdquo;</em>. A second tweet claimed that the development was providing £12.5m towards the new leisure centre (costing £25m), but as we can see below from the <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/305818_1.pdf">legal agreement</a> the figure is actually only £3.5m. Lend Lease got out of providing any on-site affordable housing or making any payment in-lieu for the development through the magic of viability assessments and as we showed in a <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/01/11/flogging-the-elephant/">previous blog</a> Southwark should have netted £33.2m under its <a href="/images/affordablehousingspg.pdf">in-lieu affordable housing payment tariff</a>.<br/>
<a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/305818_1.pdf"><img class="center" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/leisurecentrecontribution.png"></a></p>

<p>Southwark also <a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LandRegistry_OneTheElephant.pdf">sold</a> the <strong>One the Elephant</strong> land to Lend Lease for the price of £6.5m (£4.6m per acre), which is a bargain considering that the gross development value of the tower will be upwards of £230m<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Our interactive map also shows how this compares to other land sales at the Elephant:</p>

Ms Woods might also be interested in the risks local authorities run when they enter into partnership agreements with global property giants like Lend Lease, as illustrated by <a href="http://www.architectureanddesign.com.au/news/lend-lease-nsw-government-dispute-halts-barangaroo">this story</a> from its other major development site in Sydney, Australia, where city authorities stand to lose millions after losing a bitter court battle with Lend Lease over a profit-share agreement.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="http://35percent.org/images/viability.png" width="300" height="200">The Heygate viability assessment saga took a new turn last week. Southwark Council failed to produce the assessment by the given deadline and all parties have been called back to a Tribunal hearing on 11th Dec.</p>

<p>We can only speculate on the cause of the delay, but Southwark Council is beginning to look a bit ridiculous. After spending a six-figure sum and two and a half years appealing against the Information Commissioner, last week Southwark claimed that it has <em>&ldquo;always been keen to see this matter resolved as quickly as possible&rdquo;</em> and that <em>&ldquo;the final version of the document is now on its way to Mr Glasspool&rdquo;</em> .</p>

<p><a href="http://35percent.org/images/SN29Oct2014.pdf"><img class="left" src="http://allpeoplesparty.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Southwark-Council-Release-Heygate-Deal-Now.png" width="500" height="300"></a></p>

<p>There are still serious oustanding questions about many aspects of the redevelopment, not just about the amount of affordable housing that the assessment can help answer (see our <a href="http://35percent.org/heygate-regeneration-faq/">FAQ</a> for a summary of the issues). Both the Information Commissioner and Information Tribunal have ruled that it is heavily in the public interest for this document to be revealed; Southwark should release the assessment without any further delay.</p>

<h2>Spot the difference</h2>

<p>While the tribunal case drags on, Lend Lease are motoring forward with the latest detailed planning application for the Heygate (now known as <a href="http://www.elephantpark.co.uk/">&lsquo;Elephant Park&rsquo;</a>). The application for <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1779/lend_lease_submits_detailed_planning_application_for_around_600_new_homes_at_elephant_park">West Grove (phase MP2)</a> comprises 593 new homes and 43,000 square feet of new retail space.</p>

<p>One thing we have noticed is that the <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5621">visualisations</a> of the new Heygate supplied during public consultations on the outline application, were based on minimum plot/building sizes. To nobody&rsquo;s surprise it is the maximum plot sizes that Lend Lease are applying for in their detailed applications and as we can see from the image below<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, it makes for a significant difference. It seems that it&rsquo;s only now that we are becoming privy to the true scale of development.</p>

<p><a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/389783_1.pdf"><img src="/images/parameterheights.png"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/389805_1.pdf"><img class="right" src="/images/mp2affordablehousing.png" width="300" height="300"></a>Despite its size however, Lend Lease can only find room for 26 social rented flats in its latest phase, which won&rsquo;t make much of a dent in Southwark&rsquo;s 20,000-strong housing waiting list.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br></p>

<h2>More viability struggles</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just in Southwark where people are challenging the viability trump card and fighting developers for properly affordable housing. Two notable examples elsewhere are <a href="http://www.wcdg.net/content/waterloos-don-quixote-one-man-against-world">Riverside Communities vs Braeburn estates</a> at the Southbank&rsquo;s Shell Centre development, where developers are getting away with building just 11% affordable housing; and <a href="http://www.eastlondonlines.co.uk/2014/11/stokey-local-votes-to-take-planning-proposal-fight-to-court-of-appeal/">Stokey Local Community Group vs Sainsburys</a> who want to build a new supermarket and flats, but have reduced their offer of affordable housing from 50% to 17%. In both cases, campaigners are trying to get to the truth about viability and pierce the legal smoke screens of commercial confidentiality.</p>

<h2>Cooltan stuffed</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="https://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_0363.jpg?w=208&h=182" width="300" height="200">A new housing and student residence development was approved for Walworth road&rsquo;s Blanchard site last week, to the great disappointment of local mental health charity <a href="http://www.cooltanarts.org.uk/">Cooltan Arts</a> and its many supporters.  A previously approved application contained a legally binding agreement to supply Cooltan (who were previous occupants of the site) with new premises. The site (plus agreement) was sold to another developer, the planning agreement lapsed and the new developer said it was not economically viable to provide Cooltan with what it needed. Southwark Council claimed it had no power to enforce the lapsed agreement and the application was duly approved.</p>

<h2>Coming soon&hellip; a fairer future</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="http://35percent.org/images/fairerfuture.png">Southwark Council is beginning its consultation on the New Southwark Plan, which will both incorporate and replace the existing Southwark Plan and Core Strategy planning policy frameworks. It will determine how all land in Southwark will be developed - or not as the case may be. Contentious issues are likely going to be the possible regeneration of council estates, the density of new developments and the protection of green spaces.</p>

<p>The paragraph below in the foreword of the <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/11161/new_southwark_plan">draft new Plan</a> caught our eye. Southwark&rsquo;s intention to use infill land and pursue estate regeneration as a way of providing 11,000 new council homes, explains why it feels the need to make a <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s47489/Appendix%201%20Draft%20Charter%20of%20Principles.pdf">Charter of Principles</a> of good behaviour when it consults with its council estate residents.<br/>
<img class="center" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/newsouthwarkplan.png"></p>

<p>The consultation period for this first draft of the New Southwark Plan and this proposal lasts until 6th March 2015, but Southwark isn&rsquo;t wasting time: an &lsquo;asset management&rsquo; process is already <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/10/04/lets-talk-about-peters-promises/">in train</a> and will be making recommendations about potential renewal/regeneration sites to Southwark&rsquo;s Cabinet in December.</p>

<h2>Estate renewal conference</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.futureoflondon.org.uk/2014/09/30/conference-delivering-estate-renewal/"><img class="right" src="http://www.futureoflondon.org.uk/futureoflondon/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Delivering-Estate-Renewal-postcard-front-1024x721.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a>Last week saw a <a href="http://www.futureoflondon.org.uk">Future of London</a> conference entitled <a href="http://www.futureoflondon.org.uk/2014/09/30/conference-delivering-estate-renewal/">&lsquo;Delivering Estate Renewal&rsquo;</a>. The conference was co-sponsored by Lend Lease who are described in the <a href="http://www.futureoflondon.org.uk/2014/09/30/conference-delivering-estate-renewal/">conference programme</a> as &lsquo;estate-savvy developers&rsquo;. The speakers included representatives from Lend Lease, Notting Hill&rsquo;s CEO Kate Davies and Southwark&rsquo;s Head of Regeneration, Stephen Platts.</p>

<p>A detailed <a href="http://chrisbrown.regen.net/2014/11/10/estate-renewal-community-coproduction/">write-up</a> of the event by Chris Brown from <a href="http://www.iglooregeneration.co.uk/">Igloo Regeneration</a> describes the arithmetic behind the crude logic of estate renewal: a council estate&rsquo;s rental income is subtracted from forecasted maintenance costs to give a &lsquo;net present cost&rsquo;; this is then compared against the estimated development value of the estate as a cleared site, so that local authorities can <em>&ldquo;get rid of the financial underperformers&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p>Brown says that he was <em>&ldquo;taken to task&rdquo;</em> during the conference, by Southwark&rsquo;s Stephen Platts over his <em>&ldquo;description of the Heygate estate renewal as a social disaster&rdquo;</em> and that his attempts to highlight the social cost of displacing communities seemed to fall on deaf ears.</p>

<h2>Baby shard gets go-ahead</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/1415187088_46.233.112.163.jpg" width="300" height="400">Irvine Sellar and son James attended Southwark&rsquo;s planning committee meeting last Tuesday evening (in a chauffeur-driven limousine). They were there to watch the the council&rsquo;s labour controlled planning committee <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7931">wave through</a> their plans for a 26 storey shard satellite tower.
In presenting the proposals, James Sellar claimed that <em>&ldquo;the proposal before you tonight will for the first time bring residents into the heart of this regeneration. It will create homes and bring vibrancy, ensuring that people working in London Bridge have the opportunity to live there as well.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>However, the Sellars had submitted a viability assessment showing that they couldn&rsquo;t afford to provide any on-site affordable housing provision. Instead, they first <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7915">proposed</a> to meet their affordable housing obligations by funding the stalled redevelopment of the Wood Dene Estate in Peckham. After criticism from opposition councillors the developers have now promised to &lsquo;try&rsquo; and find somewhere in the north of the borough instead. Failing this they have agreed to make an in-lieu payment of £18m - somewhat less than the price of some penthouses currently <a href="http://www.altomagazine.com/news/inside-londons-premier-penthouse-at-neo-bankside-4283694">being sold</a> in the area.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/398988_1.pdf"><img class="right" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/aylesburynetloss.png" width="450" height="450"></a>After waiting over a month for them to be &lsquo;validated&rsquo; by the council, the planning documents for the Aylesbury estate revelopment are now online.
The application for the First Development Site seeks permission to demolish the Bradenham, Chartridge &amp; Chiltern blocks comprising 630 homes and replace them with 815 new homes (<a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeDocs&amp;TheSystemkey=9557152">ref:14-AP-3843</a>); 362 of these will be at &lsquo;target rent&rsquo; - a net loss of 204 units (provided that target rent is equivalent to social rent). The amount of free market housing on this first phase will increase from 64 homes (initially bought under right-to-buy) to 412 and there will also be 102 intermediate units.</p>

<p>The 204 social rented units lost on the first phase is a fraction of the total net loss from the Aylesbury regeneration as a whole.  The <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/398988_1.pdf">Housing Statement</a> for the outline application <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeDocs&amp;TheSystemkey=9557153">(2,735 new homes - ref:14/AP/3844)</a> shows that the social rented housing provision will be reduced by over a third, with a net loss of 934 social rented homes across the estate once the regeneration is completed.</p>

<h3>Target Rent = affordable rent or social rent?</h3>

<p>The table in paragraph 5.11 of the <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/398988_1.pdf">Housing Statement</a>, describes &lsquo;Estate Baseline&rsquo; homes as &lsquo;Target and Affordable Rent&rsquo; which they never were; they were council homes at council rents. Using &lsquo;target rent&rsquo;, &lsquo;affordable rent&rsquo; and &lsquo;social rent&rsquo; as if they are all the same thing confuses and misleads. What people really need to know is how much total rent will new-build tenants be paying, whatever the housing is called?</p>

<p><a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/279910_1.pdf"><img class="left" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/wolvertons106SR.png" width="450" height="450"></a>The previous phase of the Aylesbury redevelopment currently under construction by L&amp;Q gives good reason to worry on this point: as we reported in a <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/05/05/manx-connections-the-off-shore-home-of-the-elephants-developers/">previous blog post</a>, the <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/279910_1.pdf">legal agreement</a> for <a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/lq-wins-work-on-next-phase-of-aylesbury-plan/6522708.article">that phase</a> contains a definition of &lsquo;social rented&rsquo;, which refers to the <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/ourwork/affordable-rent">HCA definition</a> of Boris Johnson&rsquo;s &lsquo;affordable rented&rsquo; housing product of up to 80% market rents:</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/heygates106SR.png" width="450" height="400">One would normally expect to find a reference to the National Rent Regime under the definition of social rented housing in such documents. This is the regulatory framework which decides the level of social rents based - among other things - on the average level of income. Here is an example of the wording normally used in Southwark&rsquo;s legal agreements securing planning obligations.</p>

<p>Before the legal agreement securing the Aylesbury planning obligations can be signed, the application has to be approved by Southwark&rsquo;s planning committee;  Southwark is also a partner in the regeneration, so it is up to Southwark to ensure that this situation is not repeated and we don&rsquo;t end up with &lsquo;social rented housing&rsquo; that is nothing of the kind.</p>

<h3>Cycling and car parking</h3>

<p><a href="/images/aylesburycycling.png"><img class="right" src="/images/aylesburycycling.png" width="400" height="300"></a>The council recently <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7895">announced</a> plans for a &lsquo;Southwark Spine&rsquo; cycle route linking the south to the north of the borough, which is due to cut straight through the new Aylesbury development<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. However, cycle campaign groups have pointed out that the planning applications make no provision for any segregated cycle lanes, instead cyclists will be forced to continue to compete for road space on Thurlow street with buses and cars as the illustrations here show. A <a href="http://www.change.org/p/southwark-council-s-planning-committee-and-transport-department-we-want-physically-segregated-cycle-lanes-on-albany-rd-thurlow-st-and-dutch-standard-prioritised-protected-crossings-for-cyclists-pedestrians-at-cycle-route-junctions-in-the-aylesbury-es">petition</a> has been set up by cycle campaign group <a href="http://stopkillingcyclists.org.">http://stopkillingcyclists.org.</a></p>

<p>Paragraph 2.5 of the <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/397955_1.pdf">Transport Statement</a> also confirms that <em>&ldquo;the proposals are for 1378 residential car parking spaces across the development&rdquo;</em>. We think this is excessive in an area with such strong public transport links on the border of zone 1 London. The aerial photo below, taken from the application&rsquo;s <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/397933_1.pdf">Design &amp; Access statement</a> shows the Aylesbury estate masterplan in its geographical context:</p>

<p><img src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/aylesburyincontext.png"></p>

<h3>Environmental Impact</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/1824/schedule/4/made">Planning regulations</a> require major redevelopment applications to provide <em>&ldquo;An outline of the main alternatives studied by the applicant or appellant and an indication of the main reasons for the choice made, taking into account the environmental effects.&rdquo;</em> This is to ensure that developers have properly considered the environmental impact of their proposals against the possible lower impact of alternatives and refurbishment. It would appear that no such appraisal or any detailed cost/benefit analysis has been undertaken in relation to the Aylesbury redevelopment.</p>

<p>UCL&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.engineering.ucl.ac.uk/engineering-exchange/">Engineering Exchange</a> recently published a detailed <a href="http://www.engineering.ucl.ac.uk/engineering-exchange/demolition-refurbishment-social-housing/">report</a> showing that <em>&ldquo;refurbishment of housing is often preferable to demolition and reconstruction&rdquo;</em> when taking into account environmental and social factors. We saw with the Heygate that wholesale decant and demolition costs can far outstrip refurbishment costs: the council spent £65m emptying<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> &amp; £15m demolishing<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> the Heygate when comprehensive refurbishment would have cost just £35m<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Equalities Impact</h3>

<p><a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20050927/Agenda/Item%2007%20-%20The%20AylesburyEstate%20Revised%20Strategy%20-%20Annex%20D.pdf">Council papers</a> state that <em>&ldquo;the Aylesbury is a very diverse community with 67% of people belonging to a minority ethnic group&rdquo;</em>. According to the Equalities Act 2010, the planning application should have included a detailed equalities impact assessment to consider whether the planning proposals will have an adverse effect on any Black and Minority Ethnic(BME) groups. We have been unable to find any such assessment in the supporting documents for either application.</p>

<h2>Southwark suddenly &lsquo;keen to disclose viability assessment&rsquo;</h2>

<p>Southwark&rsquo;s spin doctors were in full spin this week when they <a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/SN29Oct2014.pdf">announced</a> that the council is about to disclose the Heygate viability assessment. Having spent two years and a sum running into six figures fighting the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s order to disclose the document, Southwark&rsquo;s new regen boss Mark Williams claimed <em>&ldquo;Southwark Council has always been keen to see this matter resolved as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</em> <br/>
The council&rsquo;s sudden keenness to &lsquo;resolve the matter&rsquo; has surely got nothing to do with the fact that at a recent Case Management Hearing, the Tribunal judge gave Southwark a deadline of 5th Nov to disclose the viability assessment&hellip;</p>

Hammersmith &amp; Fulham <a href="http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/News/Homes_for_residents_not_overseas_investors.asp">used their stand</a> to make a strong case for development that provides <em>&ldquo;Homes for residents, not overseas investors&rdquo;</em>. It highlighted developers using <em>&ldquo;ridiculous viability assessments that offer piffling amounts of affordable homes&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p>Islington council leader Richard Watts said in <a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/islington.pdf">his response</a> to <a href="http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/labour-councillors-urged-to-boycott-property-developers-fair-as-londons-housing-crisis-mounts/">Unite&rsquo;s call</a> for a boycott: <em>&ldquo;neither I nor anyone else from Islington council will be attending the event&rdquo;</em>. He explained that he was <em>&ldquo;deeply concerned at the lack of genuinely affordable housing in London .. and the increase in foreign investors who are pushing up housing prices to the detriment of our residents.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Southwark council leader Peter John&rsquo;s <a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/SouthwarkUniteResponse.pdf">response</a> took a different view. He said he would be unable to attend himself, but <em>&ldquo;does not agree with the request and the reasoning behind it&rdquo;</em> because the council needs to <em>&ldquo;continue working with the private sector to ensure that we can deliver as many homes as we can&rdquo;</em>. He concludes by reiterating his <em>&ldquo;commitment to build 11,000 new council homes at social rents.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>This commitment to build 11,000 new council homes has come under increasing scrutiny. Our <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/10/04/lets-talk-about-peters-promises/">previous blog post</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/07/southwark-london-regeneration-urban-renewal-social-cleansing-fears">this recent Guardian article</a> show how questions are being asked about whether they will be council homes and whether existing council homes will have to be lost for there to be any gains. So it&rsquo;s not reassuring that Southwark&rsquo;s MIPIM stand display describes the 11,000 new council homes as comprising <em>&ldquo;both private and social&rdquo;</em> housing as this image below shows:<br/>

It&rsquo;s a day out of the office, but they looked a little downcast; no doubt disappointed that Southwark was <a href="http://blog.mipimworld.com/2014/10/announcing-winners-mipim-uk-estates-gazette-awards/">beaten</a> by Croydon and Lambeth to the awards of &lsquo;Best UK Planning Authority&rsquo; and &lsquo;Best Public/Private Partnership&rsquo;.</p>

<h3>Developers ride the bus</h3>

<p><a href="http://t.co/LZwNl9yC2T"><img class="left" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/mipimbus.png" width="300" height="200"></a>We hope if you live in Southwark, you didn&rsquo;t see this bus driving down your street last week. It was full of MIPIM property developers making a quick trip from Earls Court, no doubt scoping out sites in the developer-friendly <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/10/11/southwark-gets-its-reward/">&lsquo;can do&rsquo;</a> borough of Southwark.

<h2>Evicting Aylesbury</h2>

<p><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/4/3941/14931046894_7eca1011dd_n.jpg" align="right">A High Court ruling <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/judge-blasts-southwark-council-for-evicting-sudanese-tenant-and-destroying-his-possessions-9796994.html">condemning</a> Southwark officers for having conspired to evict a tenant from an estate in its North Peckham regeneration, is followed by news of a temporary tenant on the Aylesbury estate <a href="http://housingactionsouthwarkandlambeth.wordpress.com/2014/09/27/keeping-people-in-their-homes-a-southwark-council-guide-to-homelessness/">evicted</a> and left entirely homeless. HASL staged a protest in the Council&rsquo;s HQ on Thursday accompanied by the Focus E15 mums and the evictee; and refused to leave the lobby until the poor disabled woman was given a roof over her head. Southwark <a href="http://housingactionsouthwarkandlambeth.wordpress.com/2014/10/16/massive-housing-solidarity-southwark-council-ineptitude/">acquiesced</a> to the request and she was offered temporary accommodation (albeit with stairs..)</p>

<h3>Aylesbury estate SGTO meeting</h3>

<p><a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/SGTO25OctLeaflet4.pdf"><img class="right" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/SGTOFlyer.png" width="200" height="350"></a>The disruptive impact of regenerations like the Heygate and the Aylesbury on people throughout Southwark has become more apparent day by day. It is not just that council tenants lose their homes, but that leaseholders get displaced and that housing and rehousing opportunities are lost for anyone on the council waiting list. The Southwark Group of Tenants Association has called a <a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/SGTO25OctLeaflet4.pdf">public meeting</a> about the future of the Aylesbury estate and the demolition of council homes. <a href="http://halag.wordpress.com/">Threatened Aylesbury leaseholders</a> will also be taking part in the meeting. In the meantime - 3 weeks since their submission - the Aylesbury planning applications have appeared on Southwark Council&rsquo;s planning portal (ref. numbers <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeDocs&amp;TheSystemkey=9557152">14/AP/3843</a> and <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeDocs&amp;TheSystemkey=9557153">14/AP/3844</a>) but we can&rsquo;t tell whether the applications meet with affordable housing requirements because there are still no planning documents online. Last week we emailed the council&rsquo;s planning dept to ask about the delay and we have still had no reply.</p>

<h2>Heygate FOI/EIR Tribunal Case</h2>

<p>Parties to the Heygate FOI/EIR Tribunal case reconvened at a &lsquo;Case Management Hearing&rsquo; last week. The hearing was called by respondent to the case Adrian Glasspool, who had complained that disclosure of the viability assessment had still not taken place following the Tribunal&rsquo;s decison at the beginning of May. After hearing an account of progress so far, Southwark, Lend Lease and the Information Commissioner were directed to meet on 29th October to try to resolve any outstanding issues concerning the final disclosure. The judge also asked for parties&#8217; availability for a further hearing - should it be needed - in December.</p>

<p>Another <a href="http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/42351530">challenge</a> against a developer&rsquo;s use of viability assessments in Stoke Newington can be added to the list of challenges in our <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/10/11/southwark-gets-its-reward/">previous blog post</a>. Again the developer is arguing that local people simply would not understand what it is all about, just as was the argument in the Heygate FOI/EIR Tribunal case. After 3 days of argument in the High Court, the judge has retired to consider his verdict.</p>

<h2>Lyons Review reviews viability</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/lyonsreview.png" width="200" height="75">Viability assessments are also rapidly rising up the political agenda: the <a href="http://www.yourbritain.org.uk/uploads/editor/files/The_Lyons_Housing_Review_2.pdf">Lyons Housing Review</a> commissioned by the Labour Party and published last week, has identified <em>&ldquo;substantial concerns about the way in which the viability of local plans, CIL charging schedules and sites are tested. Evidence to the review suggested that this is compounded by the fact that there is no agreed methodology for viability assessment, which allows different parties to pick the methodology most to their advantage .. evidence to the review suggested that the current arrangements create a great deal of uncertainty and complexity, which works in favour of the partner with the most skilled consultants acting for it.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The report then makes some suggestions for how the viability testing process can be improved:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Definitive guidance should be produced to ensure a single and robust methodology for viability assessments to reduce the scope for different interpretations of viability and reduce uncertainty.&rdquo;</em> It argues that an <em>&ldquo;&lsquo;open-book&rsquo; approach to negotiating site specific viability is required, to increase transparency and speed of negotiations.&rdquo;</em> It also proposes <em>&ldquo;an arbitration service for S106 on large scale developments to be funded by the parties involved in the negotiation&rdquo;</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.mipimuk-awards.co.uk/mipimukawards2014/shortlist"><img class="right" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/MipimAwards.jpg" width="350" height="230"></a>Southwark prides itself on being a &lsquo;developer friendly&rsquo; borough. It has been <a href="http://vimeo.com/71882474#t=125s">endorsed</a> by Lend Lease Director Rob Deck as a <strong>&lsquo;can do&rsquo;</strong> council and it has been <a href="http://www.mipimuk-awards.co.uk/mipimukawards2014/shortlist">shortlisted</a> (by developers) for the award of <strong>&lsquo;Best UK Planning Authority&rsquo;</strong> at next week&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.mipimuk.co.uk/"><strong>MIPIM</strong> jamboree</a>. But pressure is mounting on all councils including Southwark to withdraw from the MIPIM backscratching get-together. Over two dozen community groups, charities and trade unions have <a href="http://radicalhousingnetwork.org/mipim-uk/whos-opposing-mipim/">opposed MIPIM</a>. Unite, Britains largest union has <a href="http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/labour-councillors-urged-to-boycott-property-developers-fair-as-londons-housing-crisis-mounts/">written</a> to all of London&rsquo;s Labour-controlled councils  asking them to <em>&ldquo;withdraw from participation in MIPIM and the close relationships with private developers that the event seeks to foster.&rdquo;</em>; three have done so but not Southwark.</p>

<p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BzdVDNBCAAMCUu0.png"><img class="left" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BzdVDNBCAAMCUu0.png" width="350" height="230"></a>So it is a particulary embarrasing moment for Lend Lease to <a href="http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20141009/pdf/42ss0tfmnqrw92.pdf">announce</a> on the Sydney Stock Exchange pre-sales totalling £312m (AUD$ 570m) from just 20% of the 3,000 homes it is building at the Elephant &amp; Castle. As we detailed in our <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/09/20/setting-the-record-straight/">previous blog</a>, Southwark is going to have to wait 11 years before it gets a sniff of any profit from the Heygate and so far Southwark has received just £15m of its £50m Heygate land receipt while having spent over £65m emptying and demolishing the estate.</p>

<h2>Developers behaving badly</h2>

<p>Some good examples of bad behaviour by developers using viability assessments to avoid building affordable housing are beginning to emerge.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/neobanksidecomparison.jpg" width="400" height="300">In Southwark, properties in the Neo Bankside development, opposite Tate Modern, were  <a href="http://www.colliers.com/~/media/Files/EMEA/UK/research/residential/201202-central-london-residential-market.pdf">reported</a> to be selling for an average of <strong>£1,326 per square foot</strong> in 2012, nearly double that claimed by developer <strong>Grosvenor</strong> when planning permission was granted: <strong>Grosvenor</strong>&rsquo;s <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/6014_1.pdf">viability assessment</a> claimed its residential properties would sell for an average of just <strong>£754 per square foot</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. These figures also take no account of the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/europe-house-of-the-day-luxury-penthouse-on-the-bank-of-the-thames-photos-1412674116">unsold penthouses</a>, which are <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7512">currently on the market</a> for £22m (each). Put simply: the developer undervalued its development by at least £143m in order to avoid affordable housing requirements<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/NEOBanksidePenthouse.jpg" width="300" height="200">Southwark Council didn&rsquo;t refer the Neo Bankside viability assessment to the <a href="http://www.voa.gov.uk/DVS/index.html">District Valuer</a> or other independent expert for appraisal, but had its Internal Property Division look it over instead<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. Its Property team recommended that the council accept the developer&rsquo;s poverty plea and settle for a <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5356">conciliatory offer of a £9m in-lieu payment</a>. Based on Southwark&rsquo;s in-lieu affordable housing tariff <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> this was a whopping gain to the developer of £16.2m.
The absence of any review or reappraisal mechanism in the planning approval, means that there is no chance that Southwark - or anyone in Southwark who needs affordable housing - will benefit from the properties being sold for twice the developer&rsquo;s original estimate.</p>

<p>Developer <strong>Grosvenor</strong>&rsquo;s viability assessment can currently be <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/6014_1.pdf">viewed</a> on the council&rsquo;s planning portal. We presume this was a mistake by Southwark, so in the event that it gets removed we have uploaded a backup copy which can be viewed online <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/6014_1.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/SKMBT_DVSReport.pdf"><img class="right" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/DVSReport.png" width="200" height="350"></a>In Kensington &amp; Chelsea, the <a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/SKMBT_DVSReport.pdf">District Valuer&rsquo;s report</a> evaluating the developer&rsquo;s viability assessment for the Earl&rsquo;s Court regeneration was <a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/development/earls-court-developer-ignored-house-price-rises/7005985.article">finally disclosed</a> thanks to the efforts of local campaigners. The report was highly critical, stating that the developer&rsquo;s assessment <em>&ldquo;ignores residential growth in values that occurs between construction start on site and the commencement of marketing and phased release of the dwellings&rdquo;</em>. The report concluded by recommending that the council implement a <em>‘review mechanism’</em> so that it could increase the level of affordable housing in line with changing market conditions throughout the 22 year scheme. Unfortunately, no such review mechanism was put in place.</p>

<p>In Fitzrovia, developer <strong>TMCT Associates</strong> has adopted a different tack: instead of underestimating sales values it has inflated build costs in its application for an office to residential conversion at Eastgate House, just around the corner from Tottenham Court Rd. As is usually the case here and elsewhere, Westminster planning committee were initially denied access to the viability assessment, but councillors have now demanded to see it. <a href="http://fitzrovia.org.uk/">Fitzrovia Neighbourhood Association</a> has got there first, and it has published <a href="http://news.fitzrovia.org.uk/2014/10/09/affordable-housing-viability-and-profit/">an account</a> of what it found in its newspaper Fitzrovia News. The Developer has estimated that it will cost a staggering £1.2m <strong>per flat</strong> to convert from offices to residential.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://ystudio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gp2.jpg" width="300" height="200">Over in the huge <a href="http://knightdragon.com/greenwich-peninsula/current">Greenwich Peninsula regeneration</a> of 10,000 homes, Hong Kong developer <a href="http://knightdragon.com/"><strong>Knight Dragon</strong></a> has secured a reduction in the amount of affordable housing from 38% to 21%. Local campaigners City Peninsula Residents Association are fighting back and are due to appear at an Information Tribunal hearing in January in their efforts to reveal the viability assessment, which justifies the loss of around 1,700 affordable homes. The use of viability assessments in Greenwich <a href="http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/11500983._Pushing_poor_people_out____Greenwich_accused_of_affordable_housing_failure/">appears to be rampant</a>: none of the approved major developments over the last 12 months meets Greenwich&rsquo;s minimum requirement for 35% affordable housing.</p>

<h2>The benefit of review mechanisms</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BprjPdsCQAEG0ze.png" width="300" height="200">A recurring feature of planning approvals involving viability assessments is the absence of any review mechanism. This means that any uplift in London property prices between the approval of planning and sale of new homes will not be reflected in an increased affordable housing offer. This will be the case on the Heygate estate, where Southwark failed to follow the District Valuer&rsquo;s recommendation that a <em>&lsquo;review mechanism linked with delivery&rsquo;</em> should be made a condition of planning approval<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. The 37% increase in Southwark&rsquo;s property prices since The Heygate planning application was submitted, will therefore be translated directly into developer profit; the £101m worth of affordable housing that Lend Lease said it couldn&rsquo;t afford to provide remains permanently written off. The Heygate development is not due to be completed until 2025. Any further increase in London property prices over the next 11 years will be converted into Lend Lease profit; the measly affordable housing offer of 79 social rented units out of 2,735 new homes will remain unchanged.</p>

<p>Review/re-appraisal mechanisms for viability assessments don&rsquo;t just make good sense: as well as being in Southwark&rsquo;s case a policy requirement<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, they are recommended in the official RICS guidance on viability testing[^6].</p>

<p>Some other councils are starting to wake up to the problem of the misuse of viability assessments: Inside Housing <a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/islingtons-planning-backlash-at-developer-super-profits/7005936.article">reported</a> that Islington Council plans to <em>&ldquo;clamp down on ‘artificially pessimistic’ viability studies used by developers to minimise affordable housing obligations.&rdquo;</em> Islington Council said it comes after it had <em>&ldquo;received a ‘significant number’ of viability studies that do not provide underlying methodology and modelling. These studies are ‘unsupported by robust evidence’ and create ‘an artificially pessimistic outcome’.&rdquo;</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/SNHeygateOverage.pdf"><img src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/SN1100homes.png" width="400" align="right"></a>Southwark Council leader Peter John has pledged that the 11,000 new council homes to be built over the next 30 years will not entail the demolition of the same number of existing council homes. In an <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/10997/an_open_letter_from_cllr_peter_john_leader_of_southwark_council">open letter</a> to all residents Cllr John says;</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;To be absolutely clear, the 11,000 new homes that we promise to deliver will be new homes additional to our existing stock. These will be council homes on council rents for those that need them. It has been said that what we are intending to do is demolish 11,000 existing council homes and replace them to reach our target of 11,000. This is just not true. These are new homes and do not include the existing stock of council housing.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/200463/community_conversations/2923/lets_talk_about_new_council_homes_for_southwark"><img src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/communityconversation.png" width="300" height="200" align="left"></a>This emphatic promise has been prompted by residents’ concern about some of the questions Southwark are asking in their <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/200463/community_conversations/2923/lets_talk_about_new_council_homes_for_southwark">resident survey</a> entitled <strong>‘Let’s talk about&hellip;new council homes for Southwark’</strong>. The survey seeks resident approval of a Charter of Principals for how the Council <em>‘will work with residents on our programme of investment and renewal’</em>. The <a href="http://www.sgto.org.uk/">Southwark Group of Tenants Association</a>&rsquo;s newsletter (issue 15) says that the survey <em>‘seems to confuse the building of 11,000 homes with the ‘renewal’ or ‘redevelopment’ of estates’</em>. Southwark Defend Council Housing puts it stronger - <em>‘Southwark Council threatens massive redevelopment of its housing estates in Camberwell &amp; Peckham’</em>, and links the questions to Southwark’s new CIL <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/07/23/mystery-objector-1301/"><em>‘Estate Renewal Zone&#8217;</em></a>.</p>

<h3>..the price tag</h3>

<p><img src="http://35percent.org/images/CILChargingZones.png" width="200" align ="right">All agree that building 11,000 council homes is a good promise and is off to a good start<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but the promise now looks as if it has a price attached, a price which the resident survey is very artfully concealing. The survey talks of ‘principles’ and ‘pledges’ but makes no mention of the asset appraisal study of council stock that will determine which estates are chosen for redevelopment, nor the part the survey itself will play in making those choices. The asset appraisal study is due to be completed by December and is described in a recent council <a href="http://moderngov.southwarksites.com/documents/s47488/Report%20Long%20term%20plans%20for%20the%20delivery%20of%20new%20council%20homes.pdf">cabinet report - ‘Next steps on Developing Long Term Plans for the Delivery of New Council Homes’</a>. The report says that the council must <em>‘identify as much potential land as possible for development opportunity’</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. This requires <em>‘a detailed and comprehensive appraisal be undertaken of the performance of the Housing Revenue Account (HRA) assets’</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> (ie council homes), leading to <em>‘an assessment of their worth to the housing business’</em><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>..the <strong>Asset Performance Evaluation Tool</strong></h3>

<p>Establishing the financial ‘worth’ of each council home does not end the process. Southwark will also look at ‘non-financial’ factors – income, employment, health, education and social exclusion – to see which stock <em>‘prevents the council effectively meeting its social housing objectives’</em><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. An <em>&lsquo;Asset Performance Evaluation Tool&rsquo;</em>, which includes <em>‘a measure of social return based on feedback from engagement with residents’</em><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, will ‘enable’ the council to reach its decisions.</p>

<p>Finally Southwark will make <em>‘a correlation of these results with open market values and development potential across the stock will identify candidate groups of assets where more detailed options appraisal could result in either opportunities for additional homes or improvements in values to the overall HRA business plan, increasing the surpluses that may be available to subsidise new developments.’</em><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Putting all this into plain English, Southwark will put a financial value on each of its estates, take a look at the lifestyles of its tenants and residents and estimate how much the land is worth to developers. The ‘options’ will then open up, including sell-offs (aka ‘improvements in value to the overall HRA business plan’). Putting it even more simply, it looks like Southwark will;</p>

<ul>
<li>see how much each council estate is worth&hellip;</li>
<li>see which ones it doesn’t like&hellip;.</li>
<li>see which ones it wants to ‘redevelop’&hellip;.</li>
</ul>


<p>This all paints a rather alarming picture, particularly in light of the Heygate experience where an <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2012/12/23/1998-southwark-housing-stock-survey/">options appraisal study</a> which recommended retaining half the estate&rsquo;s buildings was ignored. The 35% campaign has requested a copy of the <strong>&lsquo;Asset Performance Evaluation Tool&rsquo;</strong> given the key part it looks like playing in the future of every Southwark council estate resident.</p>

<h2>Aylesbury - Stop Press</h2>

<p>The long-anticipated outline planning application and phase 1b/1c demolition applications have been submitted to Southwark Council. Residents in the first phase have received <a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/scan0027.pdf">this letter</a> from agents acting on behalf of Notting Hill Housing Trust and Barratt. However, despite having been submitted on 25th September, there are no planning documents online yet. All we know at the moment is that the outline application is for 2,745 new &lsquo;private and affordable units&rsquo; including 1,070 parking spaces plus retail, office &amp; community space. The detailed application proposals include 815 new homes, new roads and some <em>&lsquo;public and private open space&rsquo;</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://tradingplaces-elephant.tumblr.com/"><img class="right" src="http://33.media.tumblr.com/eb768bd9c749502c3d8926ced246593f/tumblr_nbcjwdMLuv1tklzg2o1_1280.jpg" width="200" height="300"></a>We <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/07/12/the-more-rent-seeking-elephants-at-elephant-the-better/">blogged</a> on 12th July about <a href="http://www.social-life.co/blog/post/Trading_Places_Elephant_and_Castle_regen/"><em>Social Life</em></a>, a social enterprise based on the Pullens estate. They have now completed their research on the Elephant &amp; Castle shopping centre redevelopment and how it is affecting the traders there. A concise and impressive report is now available <a href="http://tradingplaces-elephant.tumblr.com/">here</a>. Its conclusions will not surprise people familiar with the shopping centre. It says: <em>&ldquo;Overall, traders are anxious and concerned about the redvelopment. Many of the traders have mixed feelings about the plans.&rdquo;</em>;<em>&ldquo;The shopping centre is an important social space for traders, local people and regular customers and it plays a hugely important role in the social life of the local community.&rdquo;</em>;<em>&ldquo;The shopping centre supports dense networks of social relationships in the local area, across London and globally.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>We hope developers Delancey have read this report and are giving it full weight in their forthcoming planning application for the shopping centre&rsquo;s redevelopment. However, we hear from several sources that they are not treating the current occupants very well: rents are being raised and new rental agreements are in the form of licences rather than leases, which points towards them getting rid of shopkeepers rather than keeping them. An <a href="http://www.theprisma.co.uk/2014/09/21/how-changes-in-elephant-castle-will-affect-the-latino-community/">interview</a> with respected academic and Director of <a href="http://latinelephant.wordpress.com/">Latin Elephant</a> Patria Roman paints a similar picture. Nevertheless, one shopping centre leaseholder and popular venue for Latin American events appears to be fighting back - the <a href="https://www.change.org/p/southwark-council-save-the-coronet">&lsquo;Save the Coronet&rsquo; petition</a> now stands at 3,856 signatures.</p>

<h2>Sorting Office sorted?</h2>


<p><img class="left" src="http://walworthsociety.co.uk/images/Copy%20of%20image%20001%20-%20resized.jpg" width="300" height="150">Two contentious planning applications are pending just down the road from the Elephant in Walworth. One of these would see the effective demolition of a local heritage asset - the former sorting office on Penrose street, the other could jeopardise the future of much loved and valued local mental health charity <em>Cooltan Arts</em>.</p>

<p>The Sorting Office was built in 1897 and the Walworth Society has long been <a href="http://walworthsociety.co.uk/index.php/blog/116-31-penrose-street-walworths-victorian-sorting-office">campaigning</a> to have it retained as part of the extensive redevelopment of the area. A previous planning application was refused after a large number of objections to its demolition. Its owner is now back with <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeDocs&amp;TheSystemkey=9554889">another application</a> which looks like a prime example of &lsquo;facadism&rsquo;: an increasingly common practice which has been <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/aug/25/front-facade-bad-developments-ruining-historic-buildings">described</a> in the development industry as a <em>&ldquo;wilful two fingers up&rdquo;</em> to local planners.</p>

<p>The application is for 6 x 3 storey and 2 x 2 storey town houses, 8 being just below Southwark&rsquo;s threshold for an affordable housing contribution. They will be squeezed behind the retained facade and side wall, but require the demolition of the rest of the sorting office and surrounding outbuildings.</p>

<h2>Cooltan Arts - threat</h2>


<p><img class="right" src="http://www.cooltanarts.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSCF4054-lr.jpg" width="300" height="200">Cooltan Arts, long term residents of the Walworth road were relocated last year on the <a href="http://www.cooltanarts.org.uk/2013/10/cooltan-arts-community-space-for-237-walworth-road/">promise</a> that they would be able to return to redveloped premises on their former site off the Walworth road. But a revised planning application for the site no longer contains this promise to reprovide space for Cooltan (nor does it contain the amount of affordable housing required by policy). Objections to the application <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/AcolNetCGI.exe?ACTION=UNWRAP&amp;RIPNAME=Root.PgeResultDetail&amp;TheSystemkey=9553921">ref:(14/AP/0830)</a> can still be sent to <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#112;&#108;&#x61;&#110;&#x6e;&#x69;&#110;&#103;&#x2e;&#97;&#x70;&#x70;&#108;&#105;&#99;&#97;&#x74;&#105;&#111;&#x6e;&#115;&#x40;&#115;&#x6f;&#117;&#116;&#x68;&#119;&#97;&#x72;&#107;&#x2e;&#x67;&#x6f;&#x76;&#x2e;&#117;&#x6b;&#x2e;">&#x70;&#x6c;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x6e;&#x69;&#x6e;&#x67;&#46;&#97;&#112;&#x70;&#108;&#x69;&#x63;&#x61;&#116;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#115;&#x40;&#115;&#x6f;&#117;&#x74;&#104;&#x77;&#97;&#x72;&#x6b;&#x2e;&#103;&#111;&#118;&#x2e;&#x75;&#107;&#x2e;</a></p>

<h2>Developers award Southwark top marks</h2>


<p>Southwark Council has been <a href="http://www.mipimuk-awards.co.uk/mipimukawards2014/shortlist">shortlisted</a> for two awards at the latest property developers&#8217; jamboree <strong>&lsquo;MIPIM UK&rsquo;</strong>, due to be held at Kensington Olympia on 15th-17th October. Southwark is in the running to be both <em>&ldquo;UK best planning authority of the year&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;Public-Private Partnership of the Year&rdquo;</em> for the Aylesbury estate. The MIPIM awards <a href="http://www.mipimuk-awards.co.uk/mipimukawards2014/shortlist">web page</a> claims that for developers, Southwark is both <em>&ldquo;welcoming and demanding&rdquo;</em>. We agree that it is certainly welcoming but as we have shown, it is not so demanding - especially when it comes to enforcing its own minimum policies on affordable housing contributions.</p>

<p>MIPIM also states in the citation for the Aylesbury partnership award that 75% of its affordable housing will be social rented. We doubt very much that all the new social rented homes will be at social rents and suspect that the forthcoming Aylesbury outline planning application will replace at least some of it with the new so-called &lsquo;affordable rents&#8217;of up to 80% market rent.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/peter-j-mipim.jpg?w=500&h=409" width="375" height="375">MIPIM itself is usually held in sunny <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6687">Cannes</a>. In 2013 the Council leader was <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/SNCannesMipim.pdf">accused</a> of <em>&lsquo;going on a jolly&rsquo;</em> to the event paid for by developer Lend Lease and last year he <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7449">withdrew</a> after protests and demonstrations. This year it is proving equally controversial: several Councils have pulled out after media pressure and an <a href="http://southwarknotes.wordpress.com/2014/09/21/open-letter-to-southwark-council-to-not-attend-mipim/">open letter</a> signed by several local campaign groups asks Southwark to join them. So far Council leader Peter John is unimpressed.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://radicalhousingnetwork.org/">Radical Housing Network</a> is organising protests during the exhibiton on 15th - 17th October.</p>

<h2>Heygate viability assessment latest</h2>


<p>After a long appeal against the Information Commisioner&rsquo;s decision, the Information Tribunal ordered Southwark Council and Lend Lease to disclose the Heygate viability assessment back in May. The Tribunal extended the time for forwarding the assessment to the Information Commissioner back in June, but the assessment has still not been revealed. After inquiries to the Tribunal by Mr Glasspool who requested the information, a case management hearing has now been scheduled for 15th October.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Southwark Council has had its feathers ruffled by both the Guardian and the BBC lately. A <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/17/truth-property-developers-builders-exploit-planning-cities">Guardian article</a> by Oliver Wainright uses the redevelopment of the Heygate estate as an example of how developers are <em>&lsquo;exploiting planning authorities and ruining our cities&rsquo;</em>.</p>

<p>Southwark Council has posted a <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1785/setting_the_record_straight_the_true_value_of_the_elephant_and_castle_regeneration">press statement</a> <strong>&lsquo;setting the record straight&rsquo;</strong>, in which it claims it will receive <em>&ldquo;phased payments as the scheme progresses&rdquo;</em> and this will amount to <em>&ldquo;hundreds of millions&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf"><img class="center" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/HeygateLandReceipts.png"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf"><img class="right" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/rapage70.png" width="400" height="620"></a>It is true that there will be phased payments amounting to £50m (£46m for the main site + £4m for the Rodney road site) - this figure is now well known from the leaked <a href="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf">Regeneration Agreement</a>, but getting the <em>&ldquo;hundreds of millions&rdquo;</em> of pounds depends upon the so-called &lsquo;overage&rsquo; or &lsquo;super-profit&rsquo; and how much this will be, if anything, won&rsquo;t be known until the project is completed in 2025.</p>

<p>The overage will be what is left over after building costs, a 2.6% management fee and 20% priority developer return is deducted from the total sales revenue and it will be calculated according to Lend Lease&rsquo;s financial model, as detailed in a 3000 page spreadsheet known as Appendix 22 of the Heygate viability assessment. This complicated accounting process is entirely under Lend Lease&rsquo;s control and while the Council has the right to inspect the financial model, this may not guarantee the expected overage windfall as the Barangaroo Delivery Authority in Sydney Australia <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/barangaroo-public-works-in-doubt-after-government-loses-court-battle-with-lend-lease-20140821-106lke.html">is finding out</a> to its cost.</p>

<p>Any reckoning of the gain due to Southwark must also take into account the £65m<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> it has spent on Heygate decant costs plus an unquantified amount of public money devoted to regeneration since the wider E&amp;C scheme was conceived, starting with the £25m Single Regeneration Budget (SRB) funding received back in 1999.</p>

<p>On top of the Guardian’s Heygate story the BBC has taken up the plight of Aylesbury leaseholders being &lsquo;forced out of the city&rsquo;, with an <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-29098960">online article</a> and televised reports on both its London News and <a href="http://youtu.be/RtvghCKNJjQ">Inside Out programme</a> on 8th Sep. Inside Out did not think much of the paltry amount of compensation leaseholders on the Aylesbury estate were being offered, particularly in comparison to the £340k cost of one-bed properties in the area and described the situation as <em>&lsquo;the Right to Buy dream turned sour&rsquo;</em>.</p>

<p>Southwark again &lsquo;sets the record straight&rsquo; and <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1767/southwark_councils_full_response_to_bbc_inside_out_programme">insists</a> that offers such as <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/05/16/southwark-gives-green-light-to-slum-landlords/">£85k for a 1-bed flat</a> are based on <em>&ldquo;actual market evidence of properties being sold on the Aylesbury estate&rdquo;</em>. This method of basing valuations on the sales prices of other properties depressed by the prospect of demolition has been <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/05/30/aylesbury-leaseholder-fights-incestuous-valuation/">criticised</a> by the Lands Tribunal. Southwark Council&rsquo;s valuers are also pretty imaginative in the way they gather &lsquo;market evidence&rsquo;, using a <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/05/16/southwark-gives-green-light-to-slum-landlords/">1-bed property which had been illegally converted</a> to 4 beds flat as the basis of the compensation for one unfortunate leaseholder.  The derisory compensation offered to Aylesbury leaseholders is in stark contrast to the abundant profit that the builder of the Aylesbury redevelopment Barratt has just <a href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-2750592/Booming-UK-housing-market-fuels-doubling-annual-profits-Barratt.html">announced</a>.</p>

<p>The Guardian and BBC stories reflect a wide-spread public view that developers and housebuilders are making big profits at local people’s expense and taking Southwark for a ride (an <a href="https://www.change.org/p/heygate-estate-scandal-demand-an-investigation">online petition</a> demanding an investigation into the Heygate development has gained over 700 signatures in 3 days) and a couple of press releases from Southwark won’t change this view.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Notting Hill Housing Trust is an important provider of housing in Southwark, both &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; and <a href="http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,26531,440,00.htm">private</a>. It has plans to build more than 4000 homes in Southwark; 3500 of these will be on the Aylesbury estate, which it is redeveloping <a href="http://www.nottinghillhousing.org.uk/about-us/building-new-homes/our-developments/aylesbury-estate-southwark">in partnership</a> with Britain&rsquo;s largest - and the mayor&rsquo;s favourite - housebuilder Barratt Homes. According to the NHHT <a href="http://www.nottinghillhousing.org.uk/asset/view/6912.pdf">website</a>, a hybrid application comprising outline planning for the whole Aylesbury and detailed planning for the first phase is due to be submitted by the NHHT/Barratt consortium next month.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/development/greater-london-authority-allocates-404m-for-affordable-homes/7004790.article"><img class="left" src="http://35percent.org/images/nottinghillfunding.png" width="400" height="300"></a>Notting Hill has secured more money than any other housing association from the Mayor&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/housing-land/increasing-housing-supply/affordable-homes-programme">affordable housing fund</a> (£59m - nearly three times the amount of the next highest provider). However, it is <a href="http://www.cih.org/news-article/display/vpathDCR/templatedata/cih/news-article/data/Losing_social_homes_means_we_are_storing_up_trouble">well known</a> that a condition of getting money from this funding stream is that only affordable rented homes can be built - not social rented. This was <a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk//7005104.article">cited</a> by London Labour housing spokesperson Tom Copley as the reason why so few housing associations had applied for the funding, of which £380m still remains unallocated.</p>

<p>Notting Hill Housing Trust enthusiastically <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2014/06/16/notting-hill-housing-no-social-housing">endorses</a> the Mayor&rsquo;s affordable rent policies, which may explain why Boris Johnson is so happy to give it so much money.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://35percent.org/images/SouthwarkMarketRents.png">Aylesbury estate tenants will have the right to a tenancy in the new Notting Hill development and those already &lsquo;decanted&rsquo; to other parts of the borough will have the right to return, but if the affordable rents are 80% of market rent this won&rsquo;t mean very much. Southwark Council&rsquo;s recently published &lsquo;Affordable Rent Product Study&rsquo; gives £289pw as the market rent of a 1-bed flat in SE17 – 80% of this would be £231pw.  A council rent for a 1-bed flat in SE17 is currently around £100pw.</p>

<p>Southwark Council has repeatedly said in public that there would be 50% affordable housing on the new Aylesbury, of which 75% would be social rented and this was written into its <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/200211/area_action_plans/1327/aylesbury_area_action_plan">planning policy for the scheme</a>. Notting Hill Housing Trust now says that social rent is the same as affordable rent and probably thinks that people are too stupid to tell the difference.</p>

<p>We think that any Aylesbury tenant moving into one of the replacement homes should not be expected to pay much more than their current council rent. If Southwark doesn&rsquo;t want to see another Heygate-style diaspora of long-standing communities then it should hold good on its promises, stick to its policies and ensure that policy definitions are not allowed to be blurred.</p>

<h2>Notting Hill Housing Trust - Manor Place Depot</h2>


<p><img class="left" src="http://35percent.org/images/manorplace.jpg" width="300" height="200">We <a href="http://affordable.heroku.com/blog/2014/06/16/notting-hill-housing-no-social-housing/">blogged</a> in June about the prospect of no social housing in Notting Hill Housing&rsquo;s Manor Place Depot development. Since then NHHT appears to have had a change of heart.</p>

<p>One of our members visited NHHT&rsquo;s second exhibition for its Manor Place Depot development and reported back as follows:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The exhibition gave no figures for the housing , simply saying some of the housing would be affordable rent, of which social rent was as a subset.  However discussions with NHHT staff yielded the following information:</em></p>

<p><em>The 35% target for affordable housing would be met, with 95 units out of the 270 proposed.  Of these 95 units, 50% will be affordable rent and 50% shared ownership.  NHHT defines affordable rent as including social rent, and there will be some social rent though they don&rsquo;t know how much until the viability assessment.  NHHT policy, they say, is for all the family units to be at social rent.</em></p>

<p><em>Since the first exhibition, NHHT has received GLA funds for all of its sites.  This contributes £30,000 - £40,000 of the cost per unit, they say.  NHHG were unwilling to provide information as to what exact tenure mix this public funding will subsidise, and how it differs per site.</em></p>

<p><em>On affordable market rent, NHHT say they don&rsquo;t go anywhere near 80% market rent and have a cap in London of £230 (i.e. this is the maximum affordable market rent they will charge, they say).</em></p>

<p><em>They said that there will be a further exhibition in September/October ahead of the planning application in November/December.&ldquo;</em></p>

<h4>We say:</h4>


<p>Social rented housing and affordable rented housing are not one and the same thing, Notting Hill Housing Trust needs to stop muddying the waters. If it wants to start consulting meaningfully with local people it must tell them exactly how much social rented housing there will be and how much affordable rented housing there will be and exactly how much rent they will be charging for each.</p>
