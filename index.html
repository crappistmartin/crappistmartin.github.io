  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Tribunalfolderssmall.jpg" width="400" height="300">
After three years of appeals by Southwark Council &amp; development partner Lend Lease, Adrian Glasspool has finally received the <a href="http://35percent.org/collated-viability-assessments/">viability assessment</a> for the Heygate outline masterplan in response to his <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/viability_assessment_for_plannin?unfold=1">May 2012 FOI/EIR request</a>. Southwark had initially rejected the request and appealed after his subsequent complaint was <a href="http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2013/fer_0461281.ashx">upheld</a> by the Information Commissioner. A long battle through the Tribunal system then culminated in a 6 day <a href="http://35percent.org/blog/2014/02/11/heygate-tribunal-hearing-extended/">hearing</a> in February last year, followed by a <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/FirstTierDecisionHeygate.pdf">decision notice</a> directing Southwark to release the assessment minus some of its financial modelling figures<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Following a further dispute about exactly which figures could be withheld, the Tribunal resumed and issued a <a href="http://www.informationtribunal.gov.uk/DBFiles/Decision/i1505/London%20Borough%20of%20Southwark%20EA.2013.0162%20%2810.3.15%29%202nd%20Decision.pdf">final decision</a> in March this year. The viability assessment was then received in April and after examination by sympathetic industry experts we can now disclose our findings. The Heygate tribunal case has since triggered decisions to disclose viability information for other large regeneration schemes including <a href="http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2013/fer_0491596.ashx">Earls Court regeneration</a> and <a href="http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2014/fer_0524770.pdf">Greenwich Peninsula</a>.</p>

<p>As well as a copy of the disclosed viability assessment, the 35% campaign has also obtained via FOI a (heavily redacted) <a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/DVSreport_HeygateOutline.pdf">copy</a> of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/district-valuer-services-dvs/about">District Valuer Service</a>&rsquo;s appraisal of the viability assessment, commissioned by Southwark council.</p>

<h3>This is a profitability assessment- not a viability assessment</h3>

<p>Lend Lease commissioned Savills to produce the viability assessment and the first thing that becomes clear from the disclosed information is that <strong>unviable doesn&rsquo;t mean unprofitable.</strong> Savills tested to see how the development could provide an &lsquo;acceptable&rsquo; level of developer&rsquo;s return for Lend Lease (i.e. profit margin) - and set the level of affordable housing accordingly.</p>

<h3>25% is the acceptable level of profit</h3>

<p>Savills settled on 25% as an acceptable level of profit and the minimum needed to test the viability of the scheme - &lsquo;the viability benchmark&rsquo;.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/viabilitybenchmark.png"></p>

<p>No explanation is given as to why 25% profit was used as the benchmark, rather than the 20% profit Lend Lease had agreed contractually with Southwark in the Regeneration Partnership Agreement<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, but Savills does say this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/savillsdr.png"></p>

<p>The District Valuer was not impressed with this explanation. <a href="http://35percent.org/images/DVSreport_HeygateOutline.pdf"><em>&ldquo;I do not adopt the profit benchmark that Savills have adopted..&rdquo;</em></a>(page 30, para. 2)</p>

<p>He goes on:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/DVSacceptablereturn.png"></p>

<p>Nonetheless, the 25% figure (equivalent to approx £300m<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>) was still used as the benchmark to calculate the affordable housing offer. It&rsquo;s important to note here that as well as the viability assessment, <em>&ldquo;the Council keeps DVS&rsquo;s report confidential also&rdquo;</em><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>; it is not shown to planning committee councillors and there is nothing obliging the council&rsquo;s planning officers to implement or act upon any of the DVS&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>

<p>The 25% profit figure in the viability assessment serves to inflate the projected development costs and allow the consequent reduction of affordable housing. In the event the number of social rented units was reduced from the 432<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> required by policy <a href="/affordable-housing">to just 74</a> and the total number of <a href="http://www.thelondoneconomic.com/2015/03/17/trafalgar-place-a-damning-indictment-of-affordable-housing-in-london/">&lsquo;affordable&rsquo;</a> homes from 35% to 25% (a reduction of £90m worth of affordable housing<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>).</p>

<p>At the Tribunal hearing council officers acknowledged that they did not actually see the viability assessment themselves, but depended entirely upon the DVS. The District Valuer said that 25% profit was too high and the Regeneration Agreement stipulated a lower figure - 20%, so why did Southwark continue to allow the 25% to be used as the viability benchmark?</p>

<h3>Residential sales prices were underestimated</h3>

<p>An important element of the viability assessment is the anticipated sales prices of the new homes. If this is underestimated it reduces the projected profitability of the development and amount of money available for affordable housing. Savills estimated that Lend Lease&rsquo;s new flats would sell for an average of £600 per sqft<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The District Valuer flagged this up and expressed concern that these sales projections were <a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Southwark-Simon-Bevan.pdf"><em>&ldquo;too conservative&rdquo;</em></a>(para. 81). He explained that <a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/DVSreport_HeygateOutline.pdf"><em>&ldquo;much of the local sales evidence is not comparable to what is proposed&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;does not give an idea of what may be achieved following redevelopment.&rdquo;</em></a>(page 40)</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/88_LangdaleClose_SE17.JPG' width='400' height='300' title='88 Langdale Close (comparable no. 24)'><span class='caption-text'>88 Langdale Close (comparable no. 24)</span></span>The local &lsquo;comparable&rsquo; sales evidence provided in <a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Appendix12.pdf">appendix 12</a> of the viability assessment, shows just how poor the supporting evidence is. Property number 24 on the comparables list is this 2-bed ex-council flat on the Pelier estate straddling the Walworth/Camberwell borders; a long way from the 35-storey, concierge-serviced luxury towers Lend Lease is building up at the Elephant.</p>

<p>The actual sales values are now readily available and a quick trip to Lend Lease&rsquo;s marketing showroom to pick up a <a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/WestGrovePrices.pdf">price list</a>, was enough to find out that flats in <a href="http://www.elephantpark.co.uk/news-and-editorial/news/west-grove-film-premiere">&lsquo;West Grove&rsquo;</a>- the latest phase of &lsquo;Elephant Park&rsquo; (aka The new Heygate) are currently selling for an average of £1,012 per sqft - £400 per sqft more than Lend Lease&rsquo;s viability assessment estimate.</p>

<h3>Why no review mechanism?</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper left'><img class='caption' src='/images/LLWestGrove.PNG' width='400' height='300' title='Flats for sale on redeveloped Heygate (from £430k)'><span class='caption-text'>Flats for sale on redeveloped Heygate (from £430k)</span></span>As a result of the District Valuer&rsquo;s concerns about the conservative sales projections, he recommended that a &lsquo;review mechanism&rsquo; be made a condition of planning consent. He recognised that even a small increase in the sales values given could have a <a href="http://35percent.org/images/DVSreport_HeygateOutline.pdf"><em>&ldquo;significant impact on the profitability and this underlines the need to have a review mechanism.&rdquo;</em></a>(page 39, para. h).</p>

<p>Southwark however, did not think a review mechanism was worth their while; the case officer&rsquo;s <a href="http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!hgyBVuEH%2b8BxXry2bGRAtA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d">report</a> for the masterplan application said:</p>

<p><a href="http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!hgyBVuEH%2b8BxXry2bGRAtA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d"><em>&ldquo;Given that the development is phased and extends over a prolonged period, it would normally be expected that the viability situation should be reviewed so that in the event of an economic upturn an increased level of affordable housing could be secured. It should however be noted that the indicative viable level of 9.4% indicates that a very significant economic upturn would be required in order to bring the viability to a level of affordable housing above the 25% proposed in this application. Hence it is unlikely (in light of the current viability gap) that a review would secure any increase in the quantum of affordable housing that could be supported by the scheme.&rdquo;</em></a>  (paras. 153-154)</p>

<p>Southwark council acknowledges that it did not have the expertise nor the experience to appraise the viability assessment. Southwark&rsquo;s Director of Planning said in <a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Southwark-Simon-Bevan.pdf">evidence</a> given at the Tribunal <em>&ldquo;None of the council&rsquo;s planning officers has the expertise to analyse a viability assessment. The council&rsquo;s planning officers refer all viability assessments, without exception, either to the District Valuer Service, or to the council&rsquo;s internal Property Valuation team.&rdquo;</em>(para 41).</p>

<p>This is why it had to send the viability assessment to the District Valuer Service. It had so little confidence in its own ability to understand the assessment that it did not even open its critical financial model:</p>

<p><a href="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Southwark-Simon-Bevan.pdf"><em>&ldquo;The [financial] model could not be opened as the file was incompatible with the Council&rsquo;s computer systems.&rdquo;</em></a>(para. 73)</p>

<p>Nonetheless, despite being so dependent on the District Valuer, Southwark ignored his criticism of the profit level and ignored his recommendation that there should be a review mechanism. As a result Southwark has lost 358 social rented homes, while Lend Lease stands to make whacking profits.</p>

<p>Two immediate questions now arise that Southwark needs to answer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why did it fail to follow the District Valuer&rsquo;s advice?</li>
<li>Why did it allow Lend Lease&rsquo;s viability assessment to assume a profit benchmark 5% higher than had been agreed contractually? the 5% represents approximately £50m which could have been spent on affordable housing.[^4]</li>
</ul>


<p>We will be exploring possible answers to these questions and examining further aspects of the <a href="http://35percent.org/collated-viability-assessments/">disclosed viability assessment</a> in a series of blog posts to follow. Watch this space!</p>

<p>of 9052 is 905 habitable rooms; <a href="http://35percent.org/images/affordablehousingspg.pdf">Southwark&rsquo;s tariff</a> for in-lieu affordable housing payments at the Elephant is £100,000 per habitable room; £100,000 X 905
= £90.5m.</p>
