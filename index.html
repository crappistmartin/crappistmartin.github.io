  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/images/LCCAerial.jpg"><img src="/images/LCCAerial.jpg"></a>
For many local people at the Elephant &amp; Castle it feels like Déjà vu all over again. Just as the dust settles on the rubble of the Heygate estate, consultation begins on the demise of another large part of the local community.</p>

<p>Shopping Centre owner and property developer Delancey, is seeking views on its proposals for a <a href="http://elephantandcastletowncentre.co.uk/">&lsquo;new town centre&rsquo;</a> and has held an exhibition for the purpose, which ended on Saturday. It will be a mixed use development comprising large-scale retail and 1,000 new homes; and will also include a new campus for the London College of Communication, leaving its current campus to be incorporated as part of the redevelopment scheme.</p>

<p>A statement of the obvious: the proposals entail the demoliton of the current shopping centre. However, the exhibition does not dwell on this, nor does it say what will happen to the current shopkeepers and stallholders who depend on the centre for their living and provide a valuable service to the local community.</p>

<p>Nor does the exhibition say anything about the 35% affordable housing that has to be provided, despite the proposed plans describing the new housing as entirely Private Rented Sector (PRS).</p>

<p><a href="/images/newhomesforlondoners.png"><img src="/images/newhomesforlondoners.png"></a></p>

<p>We went along to the exhibition and spoke to Delancey&rsquo;s representatives, who provided answers to some of our questions; Yes, there will be affordable housing but how much hasn&rsquo;t yet been decided; and No, there will be no provision for current shopkeepers. Their leases are <em>&ldquo;coming to an end and they will have to move on&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p>Delancey suggested that some traders may be able to pick up space in its <a href="http://35percent.org/tribeca-square">Tribeca Square</a> development next door, where there should be a very small number of affordable retail units earmarked for displaced shopping centre retailers.</p>

<p>Council leader Peter John was heard giving his opinion on BBC Radio London 94.9FM yesterday, where he was ably challenged by former Labour Councillor Piers Corbyn on the merits of the proposal. Councillor John thought that raising these issues was <em>&ldquo;premature&rdquo;</em> and ducked the interviewer&rsquo;s question of what Southwark would do if the scheme does not have 35% affordable housing. The answer should have been <em>&ldquo;we will reject the planning application&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/214183721&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>


<p></br></p>

<p><img class="right" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJqClfAWcAAI6N1.png" width="400" height="400">This is Delancey&rsquo;s second public consultation event in relation to its shopping centre redevelopment and is a statutory part of the planning process. We recall the piss poor quality of their last consultation event, where local people were presented with similarly slippery, vague and misleading questions.</p>

<p>All in all, this was a very poor exhibition of Delancey&rsquo;s proposals, providing no real basis for any meaningful consultation with the local community. Southwark should send Delancey back to the drawing board and tell them to come back with a plan that accommodates current traders and delivers 35% affordable housing, then real consultation can begin.</p>

<p>It is worth reminding ourselves that even with 35% affordable housing we will only get 175 social rented units out of 1000, which is only a fraction of what we <a href="http://35percent.org/affordable-housing">lost</a> on the Heygate estate.</p>

<p>Demolition shouldn&rsquo;t be accepted as a foregone conclusion, it will be the subject of a separate planning application requiring separate approval (George Osborne permitting). Southwark must use the power it has to reject these applications to ensure it gets at least 35% affordable housing and a plan that accommodates the needs of current small traders.</p>

<h2>Double-dealing Delancey</h2>

<p>A key question in all of this is: can we trust Delancey? beyond its dubious offshore dealings and the deceitful way it avoided providing affordable housing in its neighbouring <a href="http://35percent.org/tribeca-square/">Tribeca Square</a> development, here&rsquo;s another reason why:</p>

<p>Back in 2008, when Delancey obtained planning approval for the Tribeca Square site. It signed a <a href="http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!kx6tQZNPCJomdoeiotHphA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d">legal agreement</a> with the council that was to provide affordable retail units for traders displaced from the shopping centre. Indeed this was used as one of its justifications that the scheme couldn&rsquo;t afford to provide any affordable housing<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>However, in July 2013, (at a time when the shopping centre plans had been shelved and it was <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5215">due to be refurbished</a>) Delancey <a href="http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=13/AP/2302&amp;system=DC">went back</a> to the council and had the legal agreement changed to take these units away from the displaced traders and give them to Sainsburys instead. Its <a href="http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!1764S3MSO%2biBJUp3XuUgYQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d">reason</a> for this was <em>&ldquo;the s106 agreement was signed at a time when it was expected that the E&amp;C shopping centre would be redeveloped, but we understand that this is no longer the case and question the requirement to offer these retail units to tenants of the centre in any event due to the change in circumstance.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><a href="/images/tribeca_affordablebusinessunits.png"><img src="/images/tribeca_affordablebusinessunits.png"></a></p>

<p>Less than four months later Delancey themselves bought the shopping centre and subsequently <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7258">announced</a> its intention to demolish and redevelop the site.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='/images/sainsburys.png' width='' height='' title='The supermarket that should have been small retail units for E&C traders'><span class='caption-text'>The supermarket that should have been small retail units for E&amp;C traders</span></span></p>

<p>We already aware of the scandal of the viability assessment for Delancey&rsquo;s neighbouring Tribeca Square site, which estimated sales at £539 in an area where the current sales are double that.</p>

<p>With the Heygate scandal is it not time for PJ to call an end to this viability loophole and follow Greenwich/Islington&rsquo;s lead?</p>

<p>He was asked at Council Assembly this week if he would do so and responded &hellip;.non-response.</p>

<p>Following a lively twitter exchange sparked by council leader Peter John&rsquo;s claim that the Guardian article criticising the council for rolling over to</p>

<p>Southwark Notes has been in touch with the council&rsquo;s press office asking whether the council is going to respond to the claims made in the article</p>

<p>The Guardian journalist who wrote the article confirmed yesterday that the council has not yet asked him to make any corrections to the article. <a href="https://twitter.com/ollywainwright/status/619546795329327105">https://twitter.com/ollywainwright/status/619546795329327105</a></p>
